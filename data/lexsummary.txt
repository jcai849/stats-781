First is how to define similarity between two sentences. Second is how
to compute the overall centrality of a sentence given its similarity
to other sentences. A simple way of assessing sentence centrality by
looking at the graphs in figure 3 is to count the number of similar
sentences for each sentence. We define degree centrality of a sentence
as the degree of the corresponding node in the similarity graph. 3.3
continuous lexrank the similarity graphs we have constructed to
compute degree centrality and lexrank are unweighted. 4.1 data set and
evaluation method we used duc 2003 and 2004 data sets in our
experiments. Figure 5 shows the effect of threshold for degree and
lexrank centrality on duc 2004 task 2 data. The centrality of a
sentence is measured by looking at the overall interaction of the
sentence within the cluster rather than the local value of the
sentence in its document.
