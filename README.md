This is the repository for research and communication relating to the Text Analytics Research Project (STATS 781) for Jason Cairns, supervised by Chris Wild.

The [Journal](./notes/journal.md) serves as the nucleus for the project notes, recording the account of research, as well as providing links to research and meeting notes

Please note that GitHub still has some issues parsing relative links to non-.md documents, such as pdf, and doesn't display inline latex formulae. A workaround is to clone the repository and view on an application such as [typora](https://typora.io/), but this may be tedious - if  necessary, I'm happy to just convert everything to .html for publishing
