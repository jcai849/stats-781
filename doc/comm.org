*Question*: How should this dissertation relate to Cassidy's
[[../reading/CassidyStuff/CassidyStuff/Our%20text%20analytics%20project.docx][project
outline]]?

Thoughts on data structures:

- dataframe seems ok for tidy text style data
- nested dataframe may be best for survey response data
- look at other styles (incl. non-tidy), maybe trees, as per parse trees
  etc
- Document-term matrix for tf-idf (PCA would be interesting here due to
  massive dimension)

*Reading*: [[https://www.tidytextmining.com][Text Mining with R]]:

- [X] Read Text Mining with R
- [X] Assess Twitter api

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  UI is something that will have to be organically developed as we go.

Meeting was mainly demonstration from Jason to Chris about the
preparation done, as well as Chris demonstrating to Jason the current
iNZight UX. Research so far is good, but too broad to demonstrate in the
confines of a weekly meeting - Chris suggested a [[#actions][solution]];
to set notes in a neat summary format and publish to a github repository

** Actions
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: actions
   :END:

- [X] Set notes in neat summary form (organise file structure to match)
- [X] Push to a private github repository
- [X] Give access to Chris
- [ ] +Create twitter developer account+
- [ ] +Get twitter api access token+

This meeting took place while seeing what packages exist already to
complete various tasks. We looked though the various packages I have
found. Determined that we needed to reel in and pick specific features
that we want, according to the heuristic; if it isn't obvious
immediately, get rid of it. The primary question we seek to answer with
this text analytics program is, what are people talking about, and how
do they feel about it. With this in mind, analysis for e.g. writing
styles are not to be considered (who wrote shakespeare etc.).


** Actions
- [ ] +interface (w. respect to above)+
- [ ] +lit review of twitter analysis (esp. discourse)+
- [X] Determine what text analysis really is at base, and how it relates
 to the primary question
- [X] find if subtitles can be attained easily enough
- [X] formal critique of Cassidy's project, integration w/ iNZight
- [X] scope reduction
- [X] See similar papers in stats printing room

Close assessment of textrank package and background algorithm - on the
right track for scope. Chris noted to check for survey response data
etc. from those involved with it.

** Actions

- [X] Create an example corpus for testing

Presentation of further package discoveries, for development purposes,
as well as end-user. Demonstrated the benefits and drawbacks of using
textRank, discussed the possibility of lexRank. Presented draft of
feature space - including the usefulness of categorisation of text
analytics as within- and between- texts. Much discussion dedicated to
summarisation.
