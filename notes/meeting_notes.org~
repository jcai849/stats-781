*Question*: How should this dissertation relate to Cassidy's
[[../reading/CassidyStuff/CassidyStuff/Our%20text%20analytics%20project.docx][project
outline]]?

Thoughts on data structures:

- dataframe seems ok for tidy text style data
- nested dataframe may be best for survey response data
- look at other styles (incl. non-tidy), maybe trees, as per parse trees
  etc
- Document-term matrix for tf-idf (PCA would be interesting here due to
  massive dimension)

Meeting was mainly demonstration from Jason to Chris about the
preparation done, as well as Chris demonstrating to Jason the current
iNZight UX. Research so far is good, but too broad to demonstrate in the
confines of a weekly meeting - Chris suggested a [[#actions][solution]];
to set notes in a neat summary format and publish to a github repository

This meeting took place while seeing what packages exist already to
complete various tasks. We looked though the various packages I have
found. Determined that we needed to reel in and pick specific features
that we want, according to the heuristic; if it isn't obvious
immediately, get rid of it. The primary question we seek to answer with
this text analytics program is, what are people talking about, and how
do they feel about it. With this in mind, analysis for e.g. writing
styles are not to be considered (who wrote shakespeare etc.).

Close assessment of textrank package and background algorithm - on the
right track for scope. Chris noted to check for survey response data
etc. from those involved with it.

Presentation of further package discoveries, for development purposes,
as well as end-user. Demonstrated the benefits and drawbacks of using
textRank, discussed the possibility of lexRank. Presented draft of
feature space - including the usefulness of categorisation of text
analytics as within- and between- texts. Much discussion dedicated to
summarisation.

- ☐ Development of a test-corpus; Chris has emailed some free-form
  patient responses
- ☒ Further testing of textRank (try tidy-style) on corpus
- ☒ Testing lexRank on on test corpus
- ☒ Formalise feature-space as list

capabilities

- ☐ Summarisation of Free responses using the two example datasets;
  indiv. response as token?
- ☐ Testing of standard text analysis tools on free-response data - see
  what is useful
- ☐ Test grouping variables such as survey group in the analysis
- ☐ LexRank for keywords
