### [Preparation](./TODO.md#2019-02-27)

**Question**: How should this dissertation relate to Cassidy's [project outline](../reading/CassidyStuff/CassidyStuff/Our text analytics project.docx)?

Thoughts on data structures:

- dataframe seems ok for tidy text style data
- nested dataframe may be best for survey response data
- look at other styles (incl. non-tidy), maybe trees, as per parse trees etc
- Document-term matrix for tf-idf (PCA would be interesting here due to massive dimension)

**Reading**: [Text Mining with R](https://www.tidytextmining.com): [notes](../notes/text_mining_with_r.md)

### Minutes / Summary

>  UI is something that will have to be organically developed as we go.

Meeting was mainly demonstration from Jason to Chris about the preparation done, as well as Chris demonstrating to Jason the current iNZight UX. Research so far is good, but too broad to demonstrate in the confines of a weekly meeting - Chris suggested a [solution](#actions); to set notes in a neat summary format and publish to a github repository

### Minutes / Summary

This meeting took place while seeing what packages exist already to complete various tasks. We looked though the various packages I have found. Determined that we needed to reel in and pick specific features that we want, according to the heuristic; if it isn't obvious immediately, get rid of it. The primary question we seek to answer with this text analytics program is, what are people talking about, and how do they feel about it. With this in mind, analysis for e.g. writing styles are not to be considered (who wrote shakespeare etc.).
