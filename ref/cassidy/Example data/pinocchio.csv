"26",500,""
"27",500,"No, children, you are mistaken. Once upon a time there was a piece of"
"28",500,"wood. It was not an expensive piece of wood. Far from it. Just a common"
"29",500,"block of firewood, one of those thick, solid logs that are put on the"
"30",500,"fire in winter to make cold rooms cozy and warm."
"31",500,""
"32",500,"I do not know how this really happened, yet the fact remains that"
"33",500,"one fine day this piece of wood found itself in the shop of an old"
"34",500,"carpenter. His real name was Mastro Antonio, but everyone called him"
"35",500,"Mastro Cherry, for the tip of his nose was so round and red and shiny"
"36",500,"that it looked like a ripe cherry."
"37",500,""
"38",500,"As soon as he saw that piece of wood, Mastro Cherry was filled with joy."
"39",500,"Rubbing his hands together happily, he mumbled half to himself:"
"40",500,""
"41",500,"""This has come in the nick of time. I shall use it to make the leg of a"
"42",500,"table."""
"43",500,""
"44",500,"He grasped the hatchet quickly to peel off the bark and shape the wood."
"45",500,"But as he was about to give it the first blow, he stood still with arm"
"46",500,"uplifted, for he had heard a wee, little voice say in a beseeching tone:"
"47",500,"""Please be careful! Do not hit me so hard!"""
"48",500,""
"49",500,"What a look of surprise shone on Mastro Cherry's face! His funny face"
"50",500,"became still funnier."
"51",500,""
"52",500,"He turned frightened eyes about the room to find out where that wee,"
"53",500,"little voice had come from and he saw no one! He looked under the"
"54",500,"bench--no one! He peeped inside the closet--no one! He searched among"
"55",500,"the shavings--no one! He opened the door to look up and down the"
"56",500,"street--and still no one!"
"57",500,""
"58",500,"""Oh, I see!"" he then said, laughing and scratching his Wig. ""It can"

"61",500,""
"62",500,"He struck a most solemn blow upon the piece of wood."

"67",500,"opened wide, and his tongue hung down on his chin."
"68",500,""
"69",500,"As soon as he regained the use of his senses, he said, trembling and"
"70",500,"stuttering from fright:"
"71",500,""
"72",500,"""Where did that voice come from, when there is no one around? Might it"
"73",500,"be that this piece of wood has learned to weep and cry like a child? I"
"74",500,"can hardly believe it. Here it is--a piece of common firewood, good"
"75",500,"only to burn in the stove, the same as any other. Yet--might someone be"
"76",500,"hidden in it? If so, the worse for him. I'll fix him!"""
"77",500,""
"78",500,"With these words, he grabbed the log with both hands and started to"
"79",500,"knock it about unmercifully. He threw it to the floor, against the walls"
"80",500,"of the room, and even up to the ceiling."
"81",500,""
"82",500,"He listened for the tiny voice to moan and cry. He waited two"
"83",500,"minutes--nothing; five minutes--nothing; ten minutes--nothing."

"88",500,""
"89",500,"The poor fellow was scared half to death, so he tried to sing a gay song"
"90",500,"in order to gain courage."
"91",500,""
"92",500,"He set aside the hatchet and picked up the plane to make the wood smooth"
"93",500,"and even, but as he drew it to and fro, he heard the same tiny voice."
"94",500,"This time it giggled as it spoke:"
"95",500,""
"96",500,"""Stop it! Oh, stop it! Ha, ha, ha! You tickle my stomach."""
"97",500,""
"98",500,"This time poor Mastro Cherry fell as if shot. When he opened his eyes,"

"149",500,"cup of wine. What do you think of it?"""
"150",500,""
"151",500,"""Bravo, Polendina!"" cried the same tiny voice which came from no one"

"154",500,"On hearing himself called Polendina, Mastro Geppetto turned the color of"

"260",500,"Pinocchi once--Pinocchio the father, Pinocchia the mother, and Pinocchi"

"263",500,""
"264",500,"After choosing the name for his Marionette, Geppetto set seriously to"

"267",500,"Geppetto, seeing this, felt insulted and said in a grieved tone:"

"275",500,"long, it seemed endless."
"276",500,""
"277",500,"Poor Geppetto kept cutting it and cutting it, but the more he cut, the"

"279",500,""
"280",500,"Next he made the mouth."

"289",500,"The mouth stopped laughing, but it stuck out a long tongue."
"290",500,""
"291",500,"Not wishing to start an argument, Geppetto made believe he saw nothing"
"292",500,"and went on with his work. After the mouth, he made the chin, then the"

"294",500,""
"295",500,"As he was about to put the last touches on the finger tips, Geppetto"
"296",500,"felt his wig being pulled off. He glanced up and what did he see? His"

"298",500,""
"299",500,"But instead of giving it back, Pinocchio put it on his own head, which"
"300",500,"was half swallowed up in it."

"331",500,"""Catch him! Catch him!"" Geppetto kept shouting. But the people in the"

"353",500,"All he could do was to seize Pinocchio by the back of the neck and take"

"4364",500,"together. Some played at marbles, at hopscotch, at ball. Others rode on"
"4365",500,"bicycles or on wooden horses. Some played at blindman's buff, others at"

"5713",500,"The Snail, much against her usual habit, began to run like a lizard"
"5714",500,"under a summer sun."
"5715",500,""
"5716",500,"When Pinocchio returned home, his father asked him:"
"5717",500,""
"5718",500,"""And where is the new suit?"""
"5719",500,""
"5720",500,"""I couldn't find one to fit me. I shall have to look again some other"

"5722",500,""
"5723",500,"That night, Pinocchio, instead of going to bed at ten o'clock waited"
"5724",500,"until midnight, and instead of making eight baskets, he made sixteen."
"5725",500,""
"5726",500,"After that he went to bed and fell asleep. As he slept, he dreamed of"
"5727",500,"his Fairy, beautiful, smiling, and happy, who kissed him and said to"
"5728",500,"him, ""Bravo, Pinocchio! In reward for your kind heart, I forgive you for"
"5729",500,"all your old mischief. Boys who love and take good care of their parents"
"5730",500,"when they are old and sick, deserve praise even though they may not be"

"5733",500,""
"5734",500,"At that very moment, Pinocchio awoke and opened wide his eyes."
"5735",500,""
"5736",500,"What was his surprise and his joy when, on looking himself over, he saw"
"5737",500,"that he was no longer a Marionette, but that he had become a real live"
"5738",500,"boy! He looked all about him and instead of the usual walls of straw, he"
"5739",500,"found himself in a beautifully furnished little room, the prettiest he"
"5740",500,"had ever seen. In a twinkling, he jumped down from his bed to look on"
"5741",500,"the chair standing near. There, he found a new suit, a new hat, and a"
"5742",500,"pair of shoes."
"5743",500,""
"5744",500,"As soon as he was dressed, he put his hands in his pockets and pulled"
"5745",500,"out a little leather purse on which were written the following words:"
"5746",500,""
"5747",500,"     The Fairy with Azure Hair returns"
"5748",500,"     fifty pennies to her dear Pinocchio"
"5749",500,"     with many thanks for his kind heart."
"5750",500,""
"5751",500,"The Marionette opened the purse to find the money, and behold--there"
"5752",500,"were fifty gold coins!"
"5753",500,""
"5754",500,"Pinocchio ran to the mirror. He hardly recognized himself. The bright"
"5755",500,"face of a tall boy looked at him with wide-awake blue eyes, dark brown"
"5756",500,"hair and happy, smiling lips."
"5757",500,""
"5758",500,"Surrounded by so much splendor, the Marionette hardly knew what he was"
"5759",500,"doing. He rubbed his eyes two or three times, wondering if he were still"
"5760",500,"asleep or awake and decided he must be awake."
"5761",500,""
"5762",500,"""And where is Father?"" he cried suddenly. He ran into the next room, and"
"5763",500,"there stood Geppetto, grown years younger overnight, spick and span"
"5764",500,"in his new clothes and gay as a lark in the morning. He was once more"
"5765",500,"Mastro Geppetto, the wood carver, hard at work on a lovely picture"
"5766",500,"frame, decorating it with flowers and leaves, and heads of animals."
"5767",500,""
"5768",500,"""Father, Father, what has happened? Tell me if you can,"" cried"
"5769",500,"Pinocchio, as he ran and jumped on his Father's neck."

"5771",500,"""This sudden change in our house is all your doing, my dear Pinocchio,"""

"5781",500,"""There he is,"" answered Geppetto. And he pointed to a large Marionette"
"5782",500,"leaning against a chair, head turned to one side, arms hanging limp, and"
"5783",500,"legs twisted under him."
"5784",500,""
"5785",500,"After a long, long look, Pinocchio said to himself with great content:"
"5786",500,""
"5787",500,"""How ridiculous I was as a Marionette! And how happy I am, now that I"
