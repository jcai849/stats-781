"14",140,""
"15",140,"It was four o'clock when the ceremony was over and the carriages began"
"16",140,"to arrive. There had been a crowd following all the way, owing to the"
"17",140,"exuberance of Marija Berczynskas. The occasion rested heavily upon"
"18",140,"Marija's broad shoulders--it was her task to see that all things went in"
"19",140,"due form, and after the best home traditions; and, flying wildly"
"20",140,"hither and thither, bowling every one out of the way, and scolding and"
"21",140,"exhorting all day with her tremendous voice, Marija was too eager to see"
"22",140,"that others conformed to the proprieties to consider them herself. She"
"23",140,"had left the church last of all, and, desiring to arrive first at the"
"24",140,"hall, had issued orders to the coachman to drive faster. When that"
"25",140,"personage had developed a will of his own in the matter, Marija had"
"26",140,"flung up the window of the carriage, and, leaning out, proceeded to"
"27",140,"tell him her opinion of him, first in Lithuanian, which he did not"
"28",140,"understand, and then in Polish, which he did. Having the advantage of"
"29",140,"her in altitude, the driver had stood his ground and even ventured to"
"30",140,"attempt to speak; and the result had been a furious altercation, which,"
"31",140,"continuing all the way down Ashland Avenue, had added a new swarm of"
"32",140,"urchins to the cortege at each side street for half a mile."
"33",140,""
"34",140,"This was unfortunate, for already there was a throng before the door."
"35",140,"The music had started up, and half a block away you could hear the dull"
"36",140,"""broom, broom"" of a cello, with the squeaking of two fiddles which vied"
"37",140,"with each other in intricate and altitudinous gymnastics. Seeing"
"38",140,"the throng, Marija abandoned precipitately the debate concerning the"
"39",140,"ancestors of her coachman, and, springing from the moving carriage,"
"40",140,"plunged in and proceeded to clear a way to the hall. Once within, she"
"41",140,"turned and began to push the other way, roaring, meantime, ""Eik! Eik!"
"42",140,"Uzdaryk-duris!"" in tones which made the orchestral uproar sound like"
"43",140,"fairy music."
"44",140,""
"45",140,"""Z. Graiczunas, Pasilinksminimams darzas. Vynas. Sznapsas. Wines and"
"46",140,"Liquors. Union Headquarters""--that was the way the signs ran. The"
"47",140,"reader, who perhaps has never held much converse in the language of"
"48",140,"far-off Lithuania, will be glad of the explanation that the place was"
"49",140,"the rear room of a saloon in that part of Chicago known as ""back of the"
"50",140,"yards."" This information is definite and suited to the matter of fact;"
"51",140,"but how pitifully inadequate it would have seemed to one who understood"
"52",140,"that it was also the supreme hour of ecstasy in the life of one of"
"53",140,"God's gentlest creatures, the scene of the wedding feast and the"
"54",140,"joy-transfiguration of little Ona Lukoszaite!"
"55",140,""
"56",140,"She stood in the doorway, shepherded by Cousin Marija, breathless from"
"57",140,"pushing through the crowd, and in her happiness painful to look upon."
"58",140,"There was a light of wonder in her eyes and her lids trembled, and"
"59",140,"her otherwise wan little face was flushed. She wore a muslin dress,"
"60",140,"conspicuously white, and a stiff little veil coming to her shoulders."
"61",140,"There were five pink paper roses twisted in the veil, and eleven bright"
"62",140,"green rose leaves. There were new white cotton gloves upon her hands,"
"63",140,"and as she stood staring about her she twisted them together feverishly."
"64",140,"It was almost too much for her--you could see the pain of too great"
"65",140,"emotion in her face, and all the tremor of her form. She was so"
"66",140,"young--not quite sixteen--and small for her age, a mere child; and she"
"67",140,"had just been married--and married to Jurgis,* (*Pronounced Yoorghis) of"
"68",140,"all men, to Jurgis Rudkus, he with the white flower in the buttonhole of"
"69",140,"his new black suit, he with the mighty shoulders and the giant hands."
"70",140,""
"71",140,"Ona was blue-eyed and fair, while Jurgis had great black eyes with"
"72",140,"beetling brows, and thick black hair that curled in waves about his"
"73",140,"ears--in short, they were one of those incongruous and impossible"
"74",140,"married couples with which Mother Nature so often wills to"
"75",140,"confound all prophets, before and after. Jurgis could take up a"
"76",140,"two-hundred-and-fifty-pound quarter of beef and carry it into a car"
"77",140,"without a stagger, or even a thought; and now he stood in a far corner,"
"78",140,"frightened as a hunted animal, and obliged to moisten his lips with"
"79",140,"his tongue each time before he could answer the congratulations of his"
"80",140,"friends."
"81",140,""
"82",140,"Gradually there was effected a separation between the spectators and"
"83",140,"the guests--a separation at least sufficiently complete for working"
"84",140,"purposes. There was no time during the festivities which ensued when"
"85",140,"there were not groups of onlookers in the doorways and the corners;"
"86",140,"and if any one of these onlookers came sufficiently close, or looked"
"87",140,"sufficiently hungry, a chair was offered him, and he was invited to the"
"88",140,"feast. It was one of the laws of the veselija that no one goes hungry;"
"89",140,"and, while a rule made in the forests of Lithuania is hard to apply"
"90",140,"in the stockyards district of Chicago, with its quarter of a million"
"91",140,"inhabitants, still they did their best, and the children who ran in"
"92",140,"from the street, and even the dogs, went out again happier. A charming"
"93",140,"informality was one of the characteristics of this celebration. The men"
"94",140,"wore their hats, or, if they wished, they took them off, and their coats"
"95",140,"with them; they ate when and where they pleased, and moved as often as"
"96",140,"they pleased. There were to be speeches and singing, but no one had to"
"97",140,"listen who did not care to; if he wished, meantime, to speak or sing"
"98",140,"himself, he was perfectly free. The resulting medley of sound distracted"
"99",140,"no one, save possibly alone the babies, of which there were present a"
"100",140,"number equal to the total possessed by all the guests invited. There was"
"101",140,"no other place for the babies to be, and so part of the preparations"
"102",140,"for the evening consisted of a collection of cribs and carriages in one"
"103",140,"corner. In these the babies slept, three or four together, or wakened"
"104",140,"together, as the case might be. Those who were still older, and could"
"105",140,"reach the tables, marched about munching contentedly at meat bones and"
"106",140,"bologna sausages."
"107",140,""
"108",140,""
"109",140,"The room is about thirty feet square, with whitewashed walls, bare save"
"110",140,"for a calendar, a picture of a race horse, and a family tree in a gilded"
"111",140,"frame. To the right there is a door from the saloon, with a few loafers"
"112",140,"in the doorway, and in the corner beyond it a bar, with a presiding"
"113",140,"genius clad in soiled white, with waxed black mustaches and a carefully"
"114",140,"oiled curl plastered against one side of his forehead. In the opposite"
"115",140,"corner are two tables, filling a third of the room and laden with"
"116",140,"dishes and cold viands, which a few of the hungrier guests are already"
"117",140,"munching. At the head, where sits the bride, is a snow-white cake, with"
"118",140,"an Eiffel tower of constructed decoration, with sugar roses and two"
"119",140,"angels upon it, and a generous sprinkling of pink and green and yellow"
"120",140,"candies. Beyond opens a door into the kitchen, where there is a glimpse"
"121",140,"to be had of a range with much steam ascending from it, and many women,"
"122",140,"old and young, rushing hither and thither. In the corner to the left are"
"123",140,"the three musicians, upon a little platform, toiling heroically to make"
"124",140,"some impression upon the hubbub; also the babies, similarly occupied,"
"125",140,"and an open window whence the populace imbibes the sights and sounds and"
"126",140,"odors."
"127",140,""
"128",140,"Suddenly some of the steam begins to advance, and, peering through it,"
"129",140,"you discern Aunt Elizabeth, Ona's stepmother--Teta Elzbieta, as they"
"130",140,"call her--bearing aloft a great platter of stewed duck. Behind her is"
"131",140,"Kotrina, making her way cautiously, staggering beneath a similar burden;"
"132",140,"and half a minute later there appears old Grandmother Majauszkiene, with"
"133",140,"a big yellow bowl of smoking potatoes, nearly as big as herself. So, bit"
"134",140,"by bit, the feast takes form--there is a ham and a dish of sauerkraut,"
"135",140,"boiled rice, macaroni, bologna sausages, great piles of penny buns,"
"136",140,"bowls of milk, and foaming pitchers of beer. There is also, not six feet"
"137",140,"from your back, the bar, where you may order all you please and do not"
"138",140,"have to pay for it. ""Eiksz! Graicziau!"" screams Marija Berczynskas, and"
"139",140,"falls to work herself--for there is more upon the stove inside that will"
"140",140,"be spoiled if it be not eaten."
"141",140,""
"142",140,"So, with laughter and shouts and endless badinage and merriment, the"
"143",140,"guests take their places. The young men, who for the most part have"
"144",140,"been huddled near the door, summon their resolution and advance; and the"
"145",140,"shrinking Jurgis is poked and scolded by the old folks until he consents"
"146",140,"to seat himself at the right hand of the bride. The two bridesmaids,"
"147",140,"whose insignia of office are paper wreaths, come next, and after them"
"148",140,"the rest of the guests, old and young, boys and girls. The spirit of the"
"149",140,"occasion takes hold of the stately bartender, who condescends to a plate"
"150",140,"of stewed duck; even the fat policeman--whose duty it will be, later in"
"151",140,"the evening, to break up the fights--draws up a chair to the foot of the"
"152",140,"table. And the children shout and the babies yell, and every one laughs"
"153",140,"and sings and chatters--while above all the deafening clamor Cousin"
"154",140,"Marija shouts orders to the musicians."
"155",140,""
"156",140,"The musicians--how shall one begin to describe them? All this time they"
"157",140,"have been there, playing in a mad frenzy--all of this scene must be"
"158",140,"read, or said, or sung, to music. It is the music which makes it what"
"159",140,"it is; it is the music which changes the place from the rear room of"
"160",140,"a saloon in back of the yards to a fairy place, a wonderland, a little"
"161",140,"corner of the high mansions of the sky."
"162",140,""
"163",140,"The little person who leads this trio is an inspired man. His fiddle"
"164",140,"is out of tune, and there is no rosin on his bow, but still he is an"
"165",140,"inspired man--the hands of the muses have been laid upon him. He plays"
"166",140,"like one possessed by a demon, by a whole horde of demons. You can"
"167",140,"feel them in the air round about him, capering frenetically; with their"
"168",140,"invisible feet they set the pace, and the hair of the leader of the"
"169",140,"orchestra rises on end, and his eyeballs start from their sockets, as he"
"170",140,"toils to keep up with them."
"171",140,""
"172",140,"Tamoszius Kuszleika is his name, and he has taught himself to play the"
"173",140,"violin by practicing all night, after working all day on the ""killing"
"174",140,"beds."" He is in his shirt sleeves, with a vest figured with faded gold"
"175",140,"horseshoes, and a pink-striped shirt, suggestive of peppermint candy."
"176",140,"A pair of military trousers, light blue with a yellow stripe, serve to"
"177",140,"give that suggestion of authority proper to the leader of a band. He is"
"178",140,"only about five feet high, but even so these trousers are about eight"
"179",140,"inches short of the ground. You wonder where he can have gotten them or"
"180",140,"rather you would wonder, if the excitement of being in his presence left"
"181",140,"you time to think of such things."
"182",140,""
"183",140,"For he is an inspired man. Every inch of him is inspired--you might"
"184",140,"almost say inspired separately. He stamps with his feet, he tosses his"
"185",140,"head, he sways and swings to and fro; he has a wizened-up little face,"
"186",140,"irresistibly comical; and, when he executes a turn or a flourish, his"
"187",140,"brows knit and his lips work and his eyelids wink--the very ends of"
"188",140,"his necktie bristle out. And every now and then he turns upon his"
"189",140,"companions, nodding, signaling, beckoning frantically--with every inch"
"190",140,"of him appealing, imploring, in behalf of the muses and their call."
"191",140,""
"192",140,"For they are hardly worthy of Tamoszius, the other two members of"
"193",140,"the orchestra. The second violin is a Slovak, a tall, gaunt man with"
"194",140,"black-rimmed spectacles and the mute and patient look of an overdriven"
"195",140,"mule; he responds to the whip but feebly, and then always falls"
"196",140,"back into his old rut. The third man is very fat, with a round, red,"
"197",140,"sentimental nose, and he plays with his eyes turned up to the sky and a"
"198",140,"look of infinite yearning. He is playing a bass part upon his cello,"
"199",140,"and so the excitement is nothing to him; no matter what happens in the"
"200",140,"treble, it is his task to saw out one long-drawn and lugubrious note"
"201",140,"after another, from four o'clock in the afternoon until nearly the same"
"202",140,"hour next morning, for his third of the total income of one dollar per"
"203",140,"hour."
"204",140,""
"205",140,"Before the feast has been five minutes under way, Tamoszius Kuszleika"
"206",140,"has risen in his excitement; a minute or two more and you see that he is"
"207",140,"beginning to edge over toward the tables. His nostrils are dilated and"
"208",140,"his breath comes fast--his demons are driving him. He nods and shakes"
"209",140,"his head at his companions, jerking at them with his violin, until at"
"210",140,"last the long form of the second violinist also rises up. In the end"
"211",140,"all three of them begin advancing, step by step, upon the banqueters,"
"212",140,"Valentinavyczia, the cellist, bumping along with his instrument between"
"213",140,"notes. Finally all three are gathered at the foot of the tables, and"
"214",140,"there Tamoszius mounts upon a stool."
"215",140,""
"216",140,"Now he is in his glory, dominating the scene. Some of the people are"
"217",140,"eating, some are laughing and talking--but you will make a great mistake"
"218",140,"if you think there is one of them who does not hear him. His notes"
"219",140,"are never true, and his fiddle buzzes on the low ones and squeaks and"
"220",140,"scratches on the high; but these things they heed no more than they heed"
"221",140,"the dirt and noise and squalor about them--it is out of this material"
"222",140,"that they have to build their lives, with it that they have to utter"
"223",140,"their souls. And this is their utterance; merry and boisterous, or"
"224",140,"mournful and wailing, or passionate and rebellious, this music is their"
"225",140,"music, music of home. It stretches out its arms to them, they have"
"226",140,"only to give themselves up. Chicago and its saloons and its slums fade"
"227",140,"away--there are green meadows and sunlit rivers, mighty forests and"
"228",140,"snow-clad hills. They behold home landscapes and childhood scenes"
"229",140,"returning; old loves and friendships begin to waken, old joys and griefs"
"230",140,"to laugh and weep. Some fall back and close their eyes, some beat upon"
"231",140,"the table. Now and then one leaps up with a cry and calls for this song"
"232",140,"or that; and then the fire leaps brighter in Tamoszius' eyes, and he"
"233",140,"flings up his fiddle and shouts to his companions, and away they go in"
"234",140,"mad career. The company takes up the choruses, and men and women cry out"
"235",140,"like all possessed; some leap to their feet and stamp upon the floor,"
"236",140,"lifting their glasses and pledging each other. Before long it occurs to"
"237",140,"some one to demand an old wedding song, which celebrates the beauty of"
"238",140,"the bride and the joys of love. In the excitement of this masterpiece"
"239",140,"Tamoszius Kuszleika begins to edge in between the tables, making his"
"240",140,"way toward the head, where sits the bride. There is not a foot of space"
"241",140,"between the chairs of the guests, and Tamoszius is so short that he"
"242",140,"pokes them with his bow whenever he reaches over for the low notes; but"
"243",140,"still he presses in, and insists relentlessly that his companions must"
"244",140,"follow. During their progress, needless to say, the sounds of the cello"
"245",140,"are pretty well extinguished; but at last the three are at the head, and"
"246",140,"Tamoszius takes his station at the right hand of the bride and begins to"
"247",140,"pour out his soul in melting strains."
"248",140,""
"249",140,"Little Ona is too excited to eat. Once in a while she tastes a little"
"250",140,"something, when Cousin Marija pinches her elbow and reminds her; but,"
"251",140,"for the most part, she sits gazing with the same fearful eyes of wonder."
"252",140,"Teta Elzbieta is all in a flutter, like a hummingbird; her sisters,"
"253",140,"too, keep running up behind her, whispering, breathless. But Ona seems"
"254",140,"scarcely to hear them--the music keeps calling, and the far-off look"
"255",140,"comes back, and she sits with her hands pressed together over her heart."
"256",140,"Then the tears begin to come into her eyes; and as she is ashamed to"
"257",140,"wipe them away, and ashamed to let them run down her cheeks, she turns"
"258",140,"and shakes her head a little, and then flushes red when she sees that"
"259",140,"Jurgis is watching her. When in the end Tamoszius Kuszleika has reached"
"260",140,"her side, and is waving his magic wand above her, Ona's cheeks are"
"261",140,"scarlet, and she looks as if she would have to get up and run away."
"262",140,""
"263",140,"In this crisis, however, she is saved by Marija Berczynskas, whom"
"264",140,"the muses suddenly visit. Marija is fond of a song, a song of lovers'"
"265",140,"parting; she wishes to hear it, and, as the musicians do not know it,"
"266",140,"she has risen, and is proceeding to teach them. Marija is short, but"
"267",140,"powerful in build. She works in a canning factory, and all day long she"
"268",140,"handles cans of beef that weigh fourteen pounds. She has a broad"
"269",140,"Slavic face, with prominent red cheeks. When she opens her mouth, it"
"270",140,"is tragical, but you cannot help thinking of a horse. She wears a blue"
"271",140,"flannel shirt-waist, which is now rolled up at the sleeves, disclosing"
"272",140,"her brawny arms; she has a carving fork in her hand, with which she"
"273",140,"pounds on the table to mark the time. As she roars her song, in a voice"
"274",140,"of which it is enough to say that it leaves no portion of the room"
"275",140,"vacant, the three musicians follow her, laboriously and note by note,"
"276",140,"but averaging one note behind; thus they toil through stanza after"
"277",140,"stanza of a lovesick swain's lamentation:--"
"278",140,""
"279",140,"     ""Sudiev' kvietkeli, tu brangiausis;"
"280",140,"     Sudiev' ir laime, man biednam,"
"281",140,"     Matau--paskyre teip Aukszcziausis,"
"282",140,"     Jog vargt ant svieto reik vienam!"""
"283",140,""
"284",140,"When the song is over, it is time for the speech, and old Dede Antanas"
"285",140,"rises to his feet. Grandfather Anthony, Jurgis' father, is not more than"
"286",140,"sixty years of age, but you would think that he was eighty. He has been"
"287",140,"only six months in America, and the change has not done him good. In his"
"288",140,"manhood he worked in a cotton mill, but then a coughing fell upon him,"
"289",140,"and he had to leave; out in the country the trouble disappeared, but he"
"290",140,"has been working in the pickle rooms at Durham's, and the breathing of"
"291",140,"the cold, damp air all day has brought it back. Now as he rises he is"
"292",140,"seized with a coughing fit, and holds himself by his chair and turns"
"293",140,"away his wan and battered face until it passes."
"294",140,""
"295",140,"Generally it is the custom for the speech at a veselija to be taken out"
"296",140,"of one of the books and learned by heart; but in his youthful days Dede"
"297",140,"Antanas used to be a scholar, and really make up all the love letters"
"298",140,"of his friends. Now it is understood that he has composed an original"
"299",140,"speech of congratulation and benediction, and this is one of the events"
"300",140,"of the day. Even the boys, who are romping about the room, draw near and"
"301",140,"listen, and some of the women sob and wipe their aprons in their eyes."
"302",140,"It is very solemn, for Antanas Rudkus has become possessed of the idea"
"303",140,"that he has not much longer to stay with his children. His speech leaves"
"304",140,"them all so tearful that one of the guests, Jokubas Szedvilas, who keeps"
"305",140,"a delicatessen store on Halsted Street, and is fat and hearty, is moved"
"306",140,"to rise and say that things may not be as bad as that, and then to go on"
"307",140,"and make a little speech of his own, in which he showers congratulations"
"308",140,"and prophecies of happiness upon the bride and groom, proceeding to"
"309",140,"particulars which greatly delight the young men, but which cause Ona"
"310",140,"to blush more furiously than ever. Jokubas possesses what his"
"311",140,"wife complacently describes as ""poetiszka vaidintuve""--a poetical"
"312",140,"imagination."
"313",140,""
"314",140,"Now a good many of the guests have finished, and, since there is no"
"315",140,"pretense of ceremony, the banquet begins to break up. Some of the men"
"316",140,"gather about the bar; some wander about, laughing and singing; here"
"317",140,"and there will be a little group, chanting merrily, and in sublime"
"318",140,"indifference to the others and to the orchestra as well. Everybody is"
"319",140,"more or less restless--one would guess that something is on their minds."
"320",140,"And so it proves. The last tardy diners are scarcely given time to"
"321",140,"finish, before the tables and the debris are shoved into the corner, and"
"322",140,"the chairs and the babies piled out of the way, and the real celebration"
"323",140,"of the evening begins. Then Tamoszius Kuszleika, after replenishing"
"324",140,"himself with a pot of beer, returns to his platform, and, standing up,"
"325",140,"reviews the scene; he taps authoritatively upon the side of his violin,"
"326",140,"then tucks it carefully under his chin, then waves his bow in an"
"327",140,"elaborate flourish, and finally smites the sounding strings and closes"
"328",140,"his eyes, and floats away in spirit upon the wings of a dreamy waltz."
"329",140,"His companion follows, but with his eyes open, watching where he treads,"
"330",140,"so to speak; and finally Valentinavyczia, after waiting for a little and"
"331",140,"beating with his foot to get the time, casts up his eyes to the ceiling"
"332",140,"and begins to saw--""Broom! broom! broom!"""
"333",140,""
"334",140,"The company pairs off quickly, and the whole room is soon in motion."
"335",140,"Apparently nobody knows how to waltz, but that is nothing of any"
"336",140,"consequence--there is music, and they dance, each as he pleases, just"
"337",140,"as before they sang. Most of them prefer the ""two-step,"" especially the"
"338",140,"young, with whom it is the fashion. The older people have dances from"
"339",140,"home, strange and complicated steps which they execute with grave"
"340",140,"solemnity. Some do not dance anything at all, but simply hold each"
"341",140,"other's hands and allow the undisciplined joy of motion to express"
"342",140,"itself with their feet. Among these are Jokubas Szedvilas and his wife,"
"343",140,"Lucija, who together keep the delicatessen store, and consume nearly"
"344",140,"as much as they sell; they are too fat to dance, but they stand in the"
"345",140,"middle of the floor, holding each other fast in their arms, rocking"
"346",140,"slowly from side to side and grinning seraphically, a picture of"
"347",140,"toothless and perspiring ecstasy."
"348",140,""
"349",140,"Of these older people many wear clothing reminiscent in some detail"
"350",140,"of home--an embroidered waistcoat or stomacher, or a gaily colored"
"351",140,"handkerchief, or a coat with large cuffs and fancy buttons. All these"
"352",140,"things are carefully avoided by the young, most of whom have learned to"
"353",140,"speak English and to affect the latest style of clothing. The girls wear"
"354",140,"ready-made dresses or shirt waists, and some of them look quite pretty."
"355",140,"Some of the young men you would take to be Americans, of the type of"
"356",140,"clerks, but for the fact that they wear their hats in the room. Each of"
"357",140,"these younger couples affects a style of its own in dancing. Some hold"
"358",140,"each other tightly, some at a cautious distance. Some hold their"
"359",140,"hands out stiffly, some drop them loosely at their sides. Some dance"
"360",140,"springily, some glide softly, some move with grave dignity. There are"
"361",140,"boisterous couples, who tear wildly about the room, knocking every one"
"362",140,"out of their way. There are nervous couples, whom these frighten, and"
"363",140,"who cry, ""Nusfok! Kas yra?"" at them as they pass. Each couple is paired"
"364",140,"for the evening--you will never see them change about. There is Alena"
"365",140,"Jasaityte, for instance, who has danced unending hours with Juozas"
"366",140,"Raczius, to whom she is engaged. Alena is the beauty of the evening,"
"367",140,"and she would be really beautiful if she were not so proud. She wears"
"368",140,"a white shirtwaist, which represents, perhaps, half a week's labor"
"369",140,"painting cans. She holds her skirt with her hand as she dances, with"
"370",140,"stately precision, after the manner of the grandes dames. Juozas is"
"371",140,"driving one of Durham's wagons, and is making big wages. He affects a"
"372",140,"""tough"" aspect, wearing his hat on one side and keeping a cigarette in"
"373",140,"his mouth all the evening. Then there is Jadvyga Marcinkus, who is also"
"374",140,"beautiful, but humble. Jadvyga likewise paints cans, but then she has"
"375",140,"an invalid mother and three little sisters to support by it, and so she"
"376",140,"does not spend her wages for shirtwaists. Jadvyga is small and delicate,"
"377",140,"with jet-black eyes and hair, the latter twisted into a little knot and"
"378",140,"tied on the top of her head. She wears an old white dress which she"
"379",140,"has made herself and worn to parties for the past five years; it is"
"380",140,"high-waisted--almost under her arms, and not very becoming,--but that"
"381",140,"does not trouble Jadvyga, who is dancing with her Mikolas. She is small,"
"382",140,"while he is big and powerful; she nestles in his arms as if she would"
"383",140,"hide herself from view, and leans her head upon his shoulder. He in turn"
"384",140,"has clasped his arms tightly around her, as if he would carry her away;"
"385",140,"and so she dances, and will dance the entire evening, and would dance"
"386",140,"forever, in ecstasy of bliss. You would smile, perhaps, to see them--but"
"387",140,"you would not smile if you knew all the story. This is the fifth year,"
"388",140,"now, that Jadvyga has been engaged to Mikolas, and her heart is sick."
"389",140,"They would have been married in the beginning, only Mikolas has a father"
"390",140,"who is drunk all day, and he is the only other man in a large family."
"391",140,"Even so they might have managed it (for Mikolas is a skilled man) but"
"392",140,"for cruel accidents which have almost taken the heart out of them. He is"
"393",140,"a beef-boner, and that is a dangerous trade, especially when you are on"
"394",140,"piecework and trying to earn a bride. Your hands are slippery, and your"
"395",140,"knife is slippery, and you are toiling like mad, when somebody happens"
"396",140,"to speak to you, or you strike a bone. Then your hand slips up on the"
"397",140,"blade, and there is a fearful gash. And that would not be so bad, only"
"398",140,"for the deadly contagion. The cut may heal, but you never can tell."
"399",140,"Twice now; within the last three years, Mikolas has been lying at home"
"400",140,"with blood poisoning--once for three months and once for nearly seven."
"401",140,"The last time, too, he lost his job, and that meant six weeks more of"
"402",140,"standing at the doors of the packing houses, at six o'clock on bitter"
"403",140,"winter mornings, with a foot of snow on the ground and more in the air."
"404",140,"There are learned people who can tell you out of the statistics that"
"405",140,"beef-boners make forty cents an hour, but, perhaps, these people have"
"406",140,"never looked into a beef-boner's hands."
"407",140,""
"408",140,"When Tamoszius and his companions stop for a rest, as perforce they"
"409",140,"must, now and then, the dancers halt where they are and wait patiently."
"410",140,"They never seem to tire; and there is no place for them to sit down"
"411",140,"if they did. It is only for a minute, anyway, for the leader starts up"
"412",140,"again, in spite of all the protests of the other two. This time it is"
"413",140,"another sort of a dance, a Lithuanian dance. Those who prefer to, go on"
"414",140,"with the two-step, but the majority go through an intricate series of"
"415",140,"motions, resembling more fancy skating than a dance. The climax of it is"
"416",140,"a furious prestissimo, at which the couples seize hands and begin a mad"
"417",140,"whirling. This is quite irresistible, and every one in the room joins"
"418",140,"in, until the place becomes a maze of flying skirts and bodies quite"
"419",140,"dazzling to look upon. But the sight of sights at this moment is"
"420",140,"Tamoszius Kuszleika. The old fiddle squeaks and shrieks in protest, but"
"421",140,"Tamoszius has no mercy. The sweat starts out on his forehead, and he"
"422",140,"bends over like a cyclist on the last lap of a race. His body shakes and"
"423",140,"throbs like a runaway steam engine, and the ear cannot follow the flying"
"424",140,"showers of notes--there is a pale blue mist where you look to see his"
"425",140,"bowing arm. With a most wonderful rush he comes to the end of the tune,"
"426",140,"and flings up his hands and staggers back exhausted; and with a final"
"427",140,"shout of delight the dancers fly apart, reeling here and there, bringing"
"428",140,"up against the walls of the room."
"429",140,""
"430",140,"After this there is beer for every one, the musicians included, and"
"431",140,"the revelers take a long breath and prepare for the great event of the"
"432",140,"evening, which is the acziavimas. The acziavimas is a ceremony which,"
"433",140,"once begun, will continue for three or four hours, and it involves one"
"434",140,"uninterrupted dance. The guests form a great ring, locking hands, and,"
"435",140,"when the music starts up, begin to move around in a circle. In the"
"436",140,"center stands the bride, and, one by one, the men step into the"
"437",140,"enclosure and dance with her. Each dances for several minutes--as long"
"438",140,"as he pleases; it is a very merry proceeding, with laughter and singing,"
"439",140,"and when the guest has finished, he finds himself face to face with Teta"
"440",140,"Elzbieta, who holds the hat. Into it he drops a sum of money--a dollar,"
"441",140,"or perhaps five dollars, according to his power, and his estimate of"
"442",140,"the value of the privilege. The guests are expected to pay for this"
"443",140,"entertainment; if they be proper guests, they will see that there is a"
"444",140,"neat sum left over for the bride and bridegroom to start life upon."
"445",140,""
"446",140,"Most fearful they are to contemplate, the expenses of this"
"447",140,"entertainment. They will certainly be over two hundred dollars and maybe"
"448",140,"three hundred; and three hundred dollars is more than the year's income"
"449",140,"of many a person in this room. There are able-bodied men here who work"
"450",140,"from early morning until late at night, in ice-cold cellars with a"
"451",140,"quarter of an inch of water on the floor--men who for six or seven"
"452",140,"months in the year never see the sunlight from Sunday afternoon till"
"453",140,"the next Sunday morning--and who cannot earn three hundred dollars in"
"454",140,"a year. There are little children here, scarce in their teens, who can"
"455",140,"hardly see the top of the work benches--whose parents have lied to get"
"456",140,"them their places--and who do not make the half of three hundred dollars"
"457",140,"a year, and perhaps not even the third of it. And then to spend such"
"458",140,"a sum, all in a single day of your life, at a wedding feast! (For"
"459",140,"obviously it is the same thing, whether you spend it at once for your"
"460",140,"own wedding, or in a long time, at the weddings of all your friends.)"
"461",140,""
"462",140,"It is very imprudent, it is tragic--but, ah, it is so beautiful! Bit by"
"463",140,"bit these poor people have given up everything else; but to this"
"464",140,"they cling with all the power of their souls--they cannot give up the"
"465",140,"veselija! To do that would mean, not merely to be defeated, but to"
"466",140,"acknowledge defeat--and the difference between these two things is what"
"467",140,"keeps the world going. The veselija has come down to them from a far-off"
"468",140,"time; and the meaning of it was that one might dwell within the cave"
"469",140,"and gaze upon shadows, provided only that once in his lifetime he could"
"470",140,"break his chains, and feel his wings, and behold the sun; provided that"
"471",140,"once in his lifetime he might testify to the fact that life, with all"
"472",140,"its cares and its terrors, is no such great thing after all, but merely"
"473",140,"a bubble upon the surface of a river, a thing that one may toss about"
"474",140,"and play with as a juggler tosses his golden balls, a thing that one may"
"475",140,"quaff, like a goblet of rare red wine. Thus having known himself for"
"476",140,"the master of things, a man could go back to his toil and live upon the"
"477",140,"memory all his days."
"478",140,""
"479",140,""
"480",140,"Endlessly the dancers swung round and round--when they were dizzy they"
"481",140,"swung the other way. Hour after hour this had continued--the darkness"
"482",140,"had fallen and the room was dim from the light of two smoky oil lamps."
"483",140,"The musicians had spent all their fine frenzy by now, and played only"
"484",140,"one tune, wearily, ploddingly. There were twenty bars or so of it, and"
"485",140,"when they came to the end they began again. Once every ten minutes or so"
"486",140,"they would fail to begin again, but instead would sink back exhausted; a"
"487",140,"circumstance which invariably brought on a painful and terrifying scene,"
"488",140,"that made the fat policeman stir uneasily in his sleeping place behind"
"489",140,"the door."
"490",140,""
"491",140,"It was all Marija Berczynskas. Marija was one of those hungry souls who"
"492",140,"cling with desperation to the skirts of the retreating muse. All day"
"493",140,"long she had been in a state of wonderful exaltation; and now it was"
"494",140,"leaving--and she would not let it go. Her soul cried out in the words of"
"495",140,"Faust, ""Stay, thou art fair!"" Whether it was by beer, or by shouting, or"
"496",140,"by music, or by motion, she meant that it should not go. And she would"
"497",140,"go back to the chase of it--and no sooner be fairly started than her"
"498",140,"chariot would be thrown off the track, so to speak, by the stupidity of"
"499",140,"those thrice accursed musicians. Each time, Marija would emit a howl and"
"500",140,"fly at them, shaking her fists in their faces, stamping upon the floor,"
"501",140,"purple and incoherent with rage. In vain the frightened Tamoszius would"
"502",140,"attempt to speak, to plead the limitations of the flesh; in vain would"
"503",140,"the puffing and breathless ponas Jokubas insist, in vain would Teta"
"504",140,"Elzbieta implore. ""Szalin!"" Marija would scream. ""Palauk! isz kelio!"
"505",140,"What are you paid for, children of hell?"" And so, in sheer terror, the"
"506",140,"orchestra would strike up again, and Marija would return to her place"
"507",140,"and take up her task."
"508",140,""
"509",140,"She bore all the burden of the festivities now. Ona was kept up by her"
"510",140,"excitement, but all of the women and most of the men were tired--the"
"511",140,"soul of Marija was alone unconquered. She drove on the dancers--what had"
"512",140,"once been the ring had now the shape of a pear, with Marija at the stem,"
"513",140,"pulling one way and pushing the other, shouting, stamping, singing, a"
"514",140,"very volcano of energy. Now and then some one coming in or out would"
"515",140,"leave the door open, and the night air was chill; Marija as she passed"
"516",140,"would stretch out her foot and kick the doorknob, and slam would go"
"517",140,"the door! Once this procedure was the cause of a calamity of which"
"518",140,"Sebastijonas Szedvilas was the hapless victim. Little Sebastijonas, aged"
"519",140,"three, had been wandering about oblivious to all things, holding turned"
"520",140,"up over his mouth a bottle of liquid known as ""pop,"" pink-colored,"
"521",140,"ice-cold, and delicious. Passing through the doorway the door smote"
"522",140,"him full, and the shriek which followed brought the dancing to a halt."
"523",140,"Marija, who threatened horrid murder a hundred times a day, and would"
"524",140,"weep over the injury of a fly, seized little Sebastijonas in her arms"
"525",140,"and bid fair to smother him with kisses. There was a long rest for the"
"526",140,"orchestra, and plenty of refreshments, while Marija was making her peace"
"527",140,"with her victim, seating him upon the bar, and standing beside him and"
"528",140,"holding to his lips a foaming schooner of beer."
"529",140,""
"530",140,"In the meantime there was going on in another corner of the room an"
"531",140,"anxious conference between Teta Elzbieta and Dede Antanas, and a few of"
"532",140,"the more intimate friends of the family. A trouble was come upon them."
"533",140,"The veselija is a compact, a compact not expressed, but therefore only"
"534",140,"the more binding upon all. Every one's share was different--and yet"
"535",140,"every one knew perfectly well what his share was, and strove to give a"
"536",140,"little more. Now, however, since they had come to the new country, all"
"537",140,"this was changing; it seemed as if there must be some subtle poison in"
"538",140,"the air that one breathed here--it was affecting all the young men at"
"539",140,"once. They would come in crowds and fill themselves with a fine dinner,"
"540",140,"and then sneak off. One would throw another's hat out of the window, and"
"541",140,"both would go out to get it, and neither could be seen again. Or now"
"542",140,"and then half a dozen of them would get together and march out openly,"
"543",140,"staring at you, and making fun of you to your face. Still others, worse"
"544",140,"yet, would crowd about the bar, and at the expense of the host drink"
"545",140,"themselves sodden, paying not the least attention to any one, and"
"546",140,"leaving it to be thought that either they had danced with the bride"
"547",140,"already, or meant to later on."
"548",140,""
"549",140,"All these things were going on now, and the family was helpless with"
"550",140,"dismay. So long they had toiled, and such an outlay they had made! Ona"
"551",140,"stood by, her eyes wide with terror. Those frightful bills--how they had"
"552",140,"haunted her, each item gnawing at her soul all day and spoiling her rest"
"553",140,"at night. How often she had named them over one by one and figured"
"554",140,"on them as she went to work--fifteen dollars for the hall, twenty-two"
"555",140,"dollars and a quarter for the ducks, twelve dollars for the musicians,"
"556",140,"five dollars at the church, and a blessing of the Virgin besides--and so"
"557",140,"on without an end! Worst of all was the frightful bill that was still to"
"558",140,"come from Graiczunas for the beer and liquor that might be consumed."
"559",140,"One could never get in advance more than a guess as to this from"
"560",140,"a saloon-keeper--and then, when the time came he always came to you"
"561",140,"scratching his head and saying that he had guessed too low, but that he"
"562",140,"had done his best--your guests had gotten so very drunk. By him you"
"563",140,"were sure to be cheated unmercifully, and that even though you thought"
"564",140,"yourself the dearest of the hundreds of friends he had. He would begin"
"565",140,"to serve your guests out of a keg that was half full, and finish with"
"566",140,"one that was half empty, and then you would be charged for two kegs of"
"567",140,"beer. He would agree to serve a certain quality at a certain price, and"
"568",140,"when the time came you and your friends would be drinking some horrible"
"569",140,"poison that could not be described. You might complain, but you would"
"570",140,"get nothing for your pains but a ruined evening; while, as for going to"
"571",140,"law about it, you might as well go to heaven at once. The saloon-keeper"
"572",140,"stood in with all the big politics men in the district; and when you had"
"573",140,"once found out what it meant to get into trouble with such people, you"
"574",140,"would know enough to pay what you were told to pay and shut up."
"575",140,""
"576",140,"What made all this the more painful was that it was so hard on the few"
"577",140,"that had really done their best. There was poor old ponas Jokubas, for"
"578",140,"instance--he had already given five dollars, and did not every one know"
"579",140,"that Jokubas Szedvilas had just mortgaged his delicatessen store for two"
"580",140,"hundred dollars to meet several months' overdue rent? And then there was"
"581",140,"withered old poni Aniele--who was a widow, and had three children, and"
"582",140,"the rheumatism besides, and did washing for the tradespeople on Halsted"
"583",140,"Street at prices it would break your heart to hear named. Aniele had"
"584",140,"given the entire profit of her chickens for several months. Eight of"
"585",140,"them she owned, and she kept them in a little place fenced around on her"
"586",140,"backstairs. All day long the children of Aniele were raking in the dump"
"587",140,"for food for these chickens; and sometimes, when the competition there"
"588",140,"was too fierce, you might see them on Halsted Street walking close to"
"589",140,"the gutters, and with their mother following to see that no one robbed"
"590",140,"them of their finds. Money could not tell the value of these chickens"
"591",140,"to old Mrs. Jukniene--she valued them differently, for she had a feeling"
"592",140,"that she was getting something for nothing by means of them--that with"
"593",140,"them she was getting the better of a world that was getting the better"
"594",140,"of her in so many other ways. So she watched them every hour of the day,"
"595",140,"and had learned to see like an owl at night to watch them then. One of"
"596",140,"them had been stolen long ago, and not a month passed that some one"
"597",140,"did not try to steal another. As the frustrating of this one attempt"
"598",140,"involved a score of false alarms, it will be understood what a tribute"
"599",140,"old Mrs. Jukniene brought, just because Teta Elzbieta had once loaned"
"600",140,"her some money for a few days and saved her from being turned out of her"
"601",140,"house."
"602",140,""
"603",140,"More and more friends gathered round while the lamentation about"
"604",140,"these things was going on. Some drew nearer, hoping to overhear the"
"605",140,"conversation, who were themselves among the guilty--and surely that was"
"606",140,"a thing to try the patience of a saint. Finally there came Jurgis,"
"607",140,"urged by some one, and the story was retold to him. Jurgis listened in"
"608",140,"silence, with his great black eyebrows knitted. Now and then there would"
"609",140,"come a gleam underneath them and he would glance about the room. Perhaps"
"610",140,"he would have liked to go at some of those fellows with his big clenched"
"611",140,"fists; but then, doubtless, he realized how little good it would do him."
"612",140,"No bill would be any less for turning out any one at this time; and then"
"613",140,"there would be the scandal--and Jurgis wanted nothing except to get away"
"614",140,"with Ona and to let the world go its own way. So his hands relaxed and"
"615",140,"he merely said quietly: ""It is done, and there is no use in weeping,"
"616",140,"Teta Elzbieta."" Then his look turned toward Ona, who stood close to his"
"617",140,"side, and he saw the wide look of terror in her eyes. ""Little one,"" he"
"618",140,"said, in a low voice, ""do not worry--it will not matter to us. We will"
"619",140,"pay them all somehow. I will work harder."" That was always what Jurgis"
"620",140,"said. Ona had grown used to it as the solution of all difficulties--""I"
"621",140,"will work harder!"" He had said that in Lithuania when one official had"
"622",140,"taken his passport from him, and another had arrested him for being"
"623",140,"without it, and the two had divided a third of his belongings. He had"
"624",140,"said it again in New York, when the smooth-spoken agent had taken them"
"625",140,"in hand and made them pay such high prices, and almost prevented their"
"626",140,"leaving his place, in spite of their paying. Now he said it a third"
"627",140,"time, and Ona drew a deep breath; it was so wonderful to have a husband,"
"628",140,"just like a grown woman--and a husband who could solve all problems, and"
"629",140,"who was so big and strong!"
"630",140,""
"631",140,"The last sob of little Sebastijonas has been stifled, and the orchestra"
"632",140,"has once more been reminded of its duty. The ceremony begins again--but"
"633",140,"there are few now left to dance with, and so very soon the collection is"
"634",140,"over and promiscuous dances once more begin. It is now after midnight,"
"635",140,"however, and things are not as they were before. The dancers are dull"
"636",140,"and heavy--most of them have been drinking hard, and have long ago"
"637",140,"passed the stage of exhilaration. They dance in monotonous measure,"
"638",140,"round after round, hour after hour, with eyes fixed upon vacancy, as if"
"639",140,"they were only half conscious, in a constantly growing stupor. The men"
"640",140,"grasp the women very tightly, but there will be half an hour together"
"641",140,"when neither will see the other's face. Some couples do not care to"
"642",140,"dance, and have retired to the corners, where they sit with their arms"
"643",140,"enlaced. Others, who have been drinking still more, wander about the"
"644",140,"room, bumping into everything; some are in groups of two or three,"
"645",140,"singing, each group its own song. As time goes on there is a variety"
"646",140,"of drunkenness, among the younger men especially. Some stagger about in"
"647",140,"each other's arms, whispering maudlin words--others start quarrels upon"
"648",140,"the slightest pretext, and come to blows and have to be pulled apart."
"649",140,"Now the fat policeman wakens definitely, and feels of his club to"
"650",140,"see that it is ready for business. He has to be prompt--for these"
"651",140,"two-o'clock-in-the-morning fights, if they once get out of hand, are"
"652",140,"like a forest fire, and may mean the whole reserves at the station. The"
"653",140,"thing to do is to crack every fighting head that you see, before there"
"654",140,"are so many fighting heads that you cannot crack any of them. There is"
"655",140,"but scant account kept of cracked heads in back of the yards, for men"
"656",140,"who have to crack the heads of animals all day seem to get into the"
"657",140,"habit, and to practice on their friends, and even on their families,"
"658",140,"between times. This makes it a cause for congratulation that by"
"659",140,"modern methods a very few men can do the painfully necessary work of"
"660",140,"head-cracking for the whole of the cultured world."
"661",140,""
"662",140,"There is no fight that night--perhaps because Jurgis, too, is"
"663",140,"watchful--even more so than the policeman. Jurgis has drunk a great"
"664",140,"deal, as any one naturally would on an occasion when it all has to be"
"665",140,"paid for, whether it is drunk or not; but he is a very steady man, and"
"666",140,"does not easily lose his temper. Only once there is a tight shave--and"
"667",140,"that is the fault of Marija Berczynskas. Marija has apparently concluded"
"668",140,"about two hours ago that if the altar in the corner, with the deity in"
"669",140,"soiled white, be not the true home of the muses, it is, at any rate,"
"670",140,"the nearest substitute on earth attainable. And Marija is just fighting"
"671",140,"drunk when there come to her ears the facts about the villains who have"
"672",140,"not paid that night. Marija goes on the warpath straight off, without"
"673",140,"even the preliminary of a good cursing, and when she is pulled off it"
"674",140,"is with the coat collars of two villains in her hands. Fortunately, the"
"675",140,"policeman is disposed to be reasonable, and so it is not Marija who is"
"676",140,"flung out of the place."
"677",140,""
"678",140,"All this interrupts the music for not more than a minute or two. Then"
"679",140,"again the merciless tune begins--the tune that has been played for the"
"680",140,"last half-hour without one single change. It is an American tune this"
"681",140,"time, one which they have picked up on the streets; all seem to know the"
"682",140,"words of it--or, at any rate, the first line of it, which they hum"
"683",140,"to themselves, over and over again without rest: ""In the good old"
"684",140,"summertime--in the good old summertime! In the good old summertime--in"
"685",140,"the good old summertime!"" There seems to be something hypnotic about"
"686",140,"this, with its endlessly recurring dominant. It has put a stupor upon"
"687",140,"every one who hears it, as well as upon the men who are playing it. No"
"688",140,"one can get away from it, or even think of getting away from it; it is"
"689",140,"three o'clock in the morning, and they have danced out all their joy,"
"690",140,"and danced out all their strength, and all the strength that unlimited"
"691",140,"drink can lend them--and still there is no one among them who has the"
"692",140,"power to think of stopping. Promptly at seven o'clock this same Monday"
"693",140,"morning they will every one of them have to be in their places at"
"694",140,"Durham's or Brown's or Jones's, each in his working clothes. If one of"
"695",140,"them be a minute late, he will be docked an hour's pay, and if he be"
"696",140,"many minutes late, he will be apt to find his brass check turned to the"
"697",140,"wall, which will send him out to join the hungry mob that waits every"
"698",140,"morning at the gates of the packing houses, from six o'clock until"
"699",140,"nearly half-past eight. There is no exception to this rule, not even"
"700",140,"little Ona--who has asked for a holiday the day after her wedding day,"
"701",140,"a holiday without pay, and been refused. While there are so many who"
"702",140,"are anxious to work as you wish, there is no occasion for incommoding"
"703",140,"yourself with those who must work otherwise."
"704",140,""
"705",140,"Little Ona is nearly ready to faint--and half in a stupor herself,"
"706",140,"because of the heavy scent in the room. She has not taken a drop, but"
"707",140,"every one else there is literally burning alcohol, as the lamps are"
"708",140,"burning oil; some of the men who are sound asleep in their chairs or"
"709",140,"on the floor are reeking of it so that you cannot go near them. Now"
"710",140,"and then Jurgis gazes at her hungrily--he has long since forgotten his"
"711",140,"shyness; but then the crowd is there, and he still waits and watches the"
"712",140,"door, where a carriage is supposed to come. It does not, and finally he"
"713",140,"will wait no longer, but comes up to Ona, who turns white and trembles."
"714",140,"He puts her shawl about her and then his own coat. They live only two"
"715",140,"blocks away, and Jurgis does not care about the carriage."
"716",140,""
"717",140,"There is almost no farewell--the dancers do not notice them, and all"
"718",140,"of the children and many of the old folks have fallen asleep of sheer"
"719",140,"exhaustion. Dede Antanas is asleep, and so are the Szedvilases, husband"
"720",140,"and wife, the former snoring in octaves. There is Teta Elzbieta, and"
"721",140,"Marija, sobbing loudly; and then there is only the silent night, with"
"722",140,"the stars beginning to pale a little in the east. Jurgis, without a"
"723",140,"word, lifts Ona in his arms, and strides out with her, and she sinks her"
"724",140,"head upon his shoulder with a moan. When he reaches home he is not sure"
"725",140,"whether she has fainted or is asleep, but when he has to hold her with"
"726",140,"one hand while he unlocks the door, he sees that she has opened her"
"727",140,"eyes."
"728",140,""
"729",140,"""You shall not go to Brown's today, little one,"" he whispers, as he"

"731",140,"I dare not! It will ruin us!"""

"740",140,""
"741",140,"Jurgis talked lightly about work, because he was young. They told him"
"742",140,"stories about the breaking down of men, there in the stockyards of"
"743",140,"Chicago, and of what had happened to them afterward--stories to make"
"744",140,"your flesh creep, but Jurgis would only laugh. He had only been there"
"745",140,"four months, and he was young, and a giant besides. There was too much"
"746",140,"health in him. He could not even imagine how it would feel to be beaten."
"747",140,"""That is well enough for men like you,"" he would say, ""silpnas, puny"
"748",140,"fellows--but my back is broad."""
"749",140,""
"750",140,"Jurgis was like a boy, a boy from the country. He was the sort of man"
"751",140,"the bosses like to get hold of, the sort they make it a grievance they"
"752",140,"cannot get hold of. When he was told to go to a certain place, he would"
"753",140,"go there on the run. When he had nothing to do for the moment, he would"
"754",140,"stand round fidgeting, dancing, with the overflow of energy that was"
"755",140,"in him. If he were working in a line of men, the line always moved"
"756",140,"too slowly for him, and you could pick him out by his impatience and"
"757",140,"restlessness. That was why he had been picked out on one important"
"758",140,"occasion; for Jurgis had stood outside of Brown and Company's ""Central"
"759",140,"Time Station"" not more than half an hour, the second day of his arrival"
"760",140,"in Chicago, before he had been beckoned by one of the bosses. Of this he"
"761",140,"was very proud, and it made him more disposed than ever to laugh at the"
"762",140,"pessimists. In vain would they all tell him that there were men in that"
"763",140,"crowd from which he had been chosen who had stood there a month--yes,"
"764",140,"many months--and not been chosen yet. ""Yes,"" he would say, ""but what"
"765",140,"sort of men? Broken-down tramps and good-for-nothings, fellows who have"
"766",140,"spent all their money drinking, and want to get more for it. Do you want"
"767",140,"me to believe that with these arms""--and he would clench his fists and"
"768",140,"hold them up in the air, so that you might see the rolling muscles--""that"
"769",140,"with these arms people will ever let me starve?"""
"770",140,""
"771",140,"""It is plain,"" they would answer to this, ""that you have come from the"

"773",140,"Jurgis had never seen a city, and scarcely even a fair-sized town, until"
"774",140,"he had set out to make his fortune in the world and earn his right"
"775",140,"to Ona. His father, and his father's father before him, and as many"
"776",140,"ancestors back as legend could go, had lived in that part of Lithuania"
"777",140,"known as Brelovicz, the Imperial Forest. This is a great tract of a"
"778",140,"hundred thousand acres, which from time immemorial has been a hunting"
"779",140,"preserve of the nobility. There are a very few peasants settled in it,"
"780",140,"holding title from ancient times; and one of these was Antanas Rudkus,"
"781",140,"who had been reared himself, and had reared his children in turn, upon"
"782",140,"half a dozen acres of cleared land in the midst of a wilderness. There"
"783",140,"had been one son besides Jurgis, and one sister. The former had been"
"784",140,"drafted into the army; that had been over ten years ago, but since that"
"785",140,"day nothing had ever been heard of him. The sister was married, and her"
"786",140,"husband had bought the place when old Antanas had decided to go with his"
"787",140,"son."
"788",140,""
"789",140,"It was nearly a year and a half ago that Jurgis had met Ona, at a"
"790",140,"horse fair a hundred miles from home. Jurgis had never expected to get"
"791",140,"married--he had laughed at it as a foolish trap for a man to walk into;"
"792",140,"but here, without ever having spoken a word to her, with no more than"
"793",140,"the exchange of half a dozen smiles, he found himself, purple in the"
"794",140,"face with embarrassment and terror, asking her parents to sell her to"
"795",140,"him for his wife--and offering his father's two horses he had been sent"
"796",140,"to the fair to sell. But Ona's father proved as a rock--the girl was yet"
"797",140,"a child, and he was a rich man, and his daughter was not to be had in"
"798",140,"that way. So Jurgis went home with a heavy heart, and that spring and"
"799",140,"summer toiled and tried hard to forget. In the fall, after the harvest"
"800",140,"was over, he saw that it would not do, and tramped the full fortnight's"
"801",140,"journey that lay between him and Ona."
"802",140,""
"803",140,"He found an unexpected state of affairs--for the girl's father had died,"
"804",140,"and his estate was tied up with creditors; Jurgis' heart leaped as he"
"805",140,"realized that now the prize was within his reach. There was Elzbieta"
"806",140,"Lukoszaite, Teta, or Aunt, as they called her, Ona's stepmother, and"
"807",140,"there were her six children, of all ages. There was also her brother"
"808",140,"Jonas, a dried-up little man who had worked upon the farm. They were"
"809",140,"people of great consequence, as it seemed to Jurgis, fresh out of the"
"810",140,"woods; Ona knew how to read, and knew many other things that he did"
"811",140,"not know, and now the farm had been sold, and the whole family was"
"812",140,"adrift--all they owned in the world being about seven hundred rubles"
"813",140,"which is half as many dollars. They would have had three times that, but"
"814",140,"it had gone to court, and the judge had decided against them, and it had"
"815",140,"cost the balance to get him to change his decision."
"816",140,""
"817",140,"Ona might have married and left them, but she would not, for she loved"
"818",140,"Teta Elzbieta. It was Jonas who suggested that they all go to America,"
"819",140,"where a friend of his had gotten rich. He would work, for his part, and"
"820",140,"the women would work, and some of the children, doubtless--they would"
"821",140,"live somehow. Jurgis, too, had heard of America. That was a country"
"822",140,"where, they said, a man might earn three rubles a day; and Jurgis"
"823",140,"figured what three rubles a day would mean, with prices as they were"
"824",140,"where he lived, and decided forthwith that he would go to America and"
"825",140,"marry, and be a rich man in the bargain. In that country, rich or poor,"
"826",140,"a man was free, it was said; he did not have to go into the army, he did"
"827",140,"not have to pay out his money to rascally officials--he might do as he"
"828",140,"pleased, and count himself as good as any other man. So America was a"
"829",140,"place of which lovers and young people dreamed. If one could only manage"
"830",140,"to get the price of a passage, he could count his troubles at an end."
"831",140,""
"832",140,"It was arranged that they should leave the following spring, and"
"833",140,"meantime Jurgis sold himself to a contractor for a certain time, and"
"834",140,"tramped nearly four hundred miles from home with a gang of men to work"
"835",140,"upon a railroad in Smolensk. This was a fearful experience, with filth"
"836",140,"and bad food and cruelty and overwork; but Jurgis stood it and came out"
"837",140,"in fine trim, and with eighty rubles sewed up in his coat. He did not"
"838",140,"drink or fight, because he was thinking all the time of Ona; and for the"
"839",140,"rest, he was a quiet, steady man, who did what he was told to, did not"
"840",140,"lose his temper often, and when he did lose it made the offender anxious"
"841",140,"that he should not lose it again. When they paid him off he dodged the"
"842",140,"company gamblers and dramshops, and so they tried to kill him; but he"
"843",140,"escaped, and tramped it home, working at odd jobs, and sleeping always"
"844",140,"with one eye open."
"845",140,""
"846",140,"So in the summer time they had all set out for America. At the last"
"847",140,"moment there joined them Marija Berczynskas, who was a cousin of Ona's."
"848",140,"Marija was an orphan, and had worked since childhood for a rich farmer"
"849",140,"of Vilna, who beat her regularly. It was only at the age of twenty that"
"850",140,"it had occurred to Marija to try her strength, when she had risen up and"
"851",140,"nearly murdered the man, and then come away."
"852",140,""
"853",140,"There were twelve in all in the party, five adults and six children--and"
"854",140,"Ona, who was a little of both. They had a hard time on the passage;"
"855",140,"there was an agent who helped them, but he proved a scoundrel, and got"
"856",140,"them into a trap with some officials, and cost them a good deal of"
"857",140,"their precious money, which they clung to with such horrible fear. This"
"858",140,"happened to them again in New York--for, of course, they knew nothing"
"859",140,"about the country, and had no one to tell them, and it was easy for a"
"860",140,"man in a blue uniform to lead them away, and to take them to a hotel and"
"861",140,"keep them there, and make them pay enormous charges to get away. The law"
"862",140,"says that the rate card shall be on the door of a hotel, but it does not"
"863",140,"say that it shall be in Lithuanian."

"865",140,""
"866",140,"It was in the stockyards that Jonas' friend had gotten rich, and so to"
"867",140,"Chicago the party was bound. They knew that one word, Chicago and that"
"868",140,"was all they needed to know, at least, until they reached the city."
"869",140,"Then, tumbled out of the cars without ceremony, they were no better off"
"870",140,"than before; they stood staring down the vista of Dearborn Street, with"
"871",140,"its big black buildings towering in the distance, unable to realize that"
"872",140,"they had arrived, and why, when they said ""Chicago,"" people no longer"
"873",140,"pointed in some direction, but instead looked perplexed, or laughed,"
"874",140,"or went on without paying any attention. They were pitiable in their"
"875",140,"helplessness; above all things they stood in deadly terror of any sort"
"876",140,"of person in official uniform, and so whenever they saw a policeman they"
"877",140,"would cross the street and hurry by. For the whole of the first day they"
"878",140,"wandered about in the midst of deafening confusion, utterly lost; and"
"879",140,"it was only at night that, cowering in the doorway of a house, they"
"880",140,"were finally discovered and taken by a policeman to the station. In the"
"881",140,"morning an interpreter was found, and they were taken and put upon a"
"882",140,"car, and taught a new word--""stockyards."" Their delight at discovering"
"883",140,"that they were to get out of this adventure without losing another share"
"884",140,"of their possessions it would not be possible to describe."
"885",140,""
"886",140,"They sat and stared out of the window. They were on a street which"
"887",140,"seemed to run on forever, mile after mile--thirty-four of them, if they"
"888",140,"had known it--and each side of it one uninterrupted row of wretched"
"889",140,"little two-story frame buildings. Down every side street they could see,"
"890",140,"it was the same--never a hill and never a hollow, but always the same"
"891",140,"endless vista of ugly and dirty little wooden buildings. Here and there"
"892",140,"would be a bridge crossing a filthy creek, with hard-baked mud shores"
"893",140,"and dingy sheds and docks along it; here and there would be a railroad"
"894",140,"crossing, with a tangle of switches, and locomotives puffing, and"
"895",140,"rattling freight cars filing by; here and there would be a great"
"896",140,"factory, a dingy building with innumerable windows in it, and immense"
"897",140,"volumes of smoke pouring from the chimneys, darkening the air above and"
"898",140,"making filthy the earth beneath. But after each of these interruptions,"
"899",140,"the desolate procession would begin again--the procession of dreary"
"900",140,"little buildings."
"901",140,""
"902",140,"A full hour before the party reached the city they had begun to note the"
"903",140,"perplexing changes in the atmosphere. It grew darker all the time, and"
"904",140,"upon the earth the grass seemed to grow less green. Every minute, as"
"905",140,"the train sped on, the colors of things became dingier; the fields were"
"906",140,"grown parched and yellow, the landscape hideous and bare. And along"
"907",140,"with the thickening smoke they began to notice another circumstance, a"
"908",140,"strange, pungent odor. They were not sure that it was unpleasant, this"
"909",140,"odor; some might have called it sickening, but their taste in odors was"
"910",140,"not developed, and they were only sure that it was curious. Now, sitting"
"911",140,"in the trolley car, they realized that they were on their way to the"
"912",140,"home of it--that they had traveled all the way from Lithuania to it."
"913",140,"It was now no longer something far off and faint, that you caught in"
"914",140,"whiffs; you could literally taste it, as well as smell it--you could"
"915",140,"take hold of it, almost, and examine it at your leisure. They were"
"916",140,"divided in their opinions about it. It was an elemental odor, raw and"
"917",140,"crude; it was rich, almost rancid, sensual, and strong. There were some"
"918",140,"who drank it in as if it were an intoxicant; there were others who put"
"919",140,"their handkerchiefs to their faces. The new emigrants were still tasting"
"920",140,"it, lost in wonder, when suddenly the car came to a halt, and the door"
"921",140,"was flung open, and a voice shouted--""Stockyards!"""
"922",140,""
"923",140,"They were left standing upon the corner, staring; down a side street"
"924",140,"there were two rows of brick houses, and between them a vista: half"
"925",140,"a dozen chimneys, tall as the tallest of buildings, touching the very"
"926",140,"sky--and leaping from them half a dozen columns of smoke, thick, oily,"
"927",140,"and black as night. It might have come from the center of the world,"
"928",140,"this smoke, where the fires of the ages still smolder. It came as if"
"929",140,"self-impelled, driving all before it, a perpetual explosion. It was"
"930",140,"inexhaustible; one stared, waiting to see it stop, but still the great"
"931",140,"streams rolled out. They spread in vast clouds overhead, writhing,"
"932",140,"curling; then, uniting in one giant river, they streamed away down the"
"933",140,"sky, stretching a black pall as far as the eye could reach."
"934",140,""
"935",140,"Then the party became aware of another strange thing. This, too, like"
"936",140,"the color, was a thing elemental; it was a sound, a sound made up of ten"
"937",140,"thousand little sounds. You scarcely noticed it at first--it sunk into"
"938",140,"your consciousness, a vague disturbance, a trouble. It was like the"
"939",140,"murmuring of the bees in the spring, the whisperings of the forest; it"
"940",140,"suggested endless activity, the rumblings of a world in motion. It was"
"941",140,"only by an effort that one could realize that it was made by animals,"
"942",140,"that it was the distant lowing of ten thousand cattle, the distant"
"943",140,"grunting of ten thousand swine."
"944",140,""
"945",140,"They would have liked to follow it up, but, alas, they had no time for"
"946",140,"adventures just then. The policeman on the corner was beginning to watch"
"947",140,"them; and so, as usual, they started up the street. Scarcely had they"
"948",140,"gone a block, however, before Jonas was heard to give a cry, and began"
"949",140,"pointing excitedly across the street. Before they could gather the"
"950",140,"meaning of his breathless ejaculations he had bounded away, and they saw"
"951",140,"him enter a shop, over which was a sign: ""J. Szedvilas, Delicatessen."""
"952",140,"When he came out again it was in company with a very stout gentleman in"
"953",140,"shirt sleeves and an apron, clasping Jonas by both hands and laughing"
"954",140,"hilariously. Then Teta Elzbieta recollected suddenly that Szedvilas"
"955",140,"had been the name of the mythical friend who had made his fortune in"
"956",140,"America. To find that he had been making it in the delicatessen business"
"957",140,"was an extraordinary piece of good fortune at this juncture; though it"
"958",140,"was well on in the morning, they had not breakfasted, and the children"
"959",140,"were beginning to whimper."
"960",140,""
"961",140,"Thus was the happy ending to a woeful voyage. The two families literally"
"962",140,"fell upon each other's necks--for it had been years since Jokubas"
"963",140,"Szedvilas had met a man from his part of Lithuania. Before half the day"
"964",140,"they were lifelong friends. Jokubas understood all the pitfalls of this"
"965",140,"new world, and could explain all of its mysteries; he could tell them"
"966",140,"the things they ought to have done in the different emergencies--and"
"967",140,"what was still more to the point, he could tell them what to do now. He"
"968",140,"would take them to poni Aniele, who kept a boardinghouse the other side"
"969",140,"of the yards; old Mrs. Jukniene, he explained, had not what one would"
"970",140,"call choice accommodations, but they might do for the moment. To this"
"971",140,"Teta Elzbieta hastened to respond that nothing could be too cheap to"
"972",140,"suit them just then; for they were quite terrified over the sums they"
"973",140,"had had to expend. A very few days of practical experience in this land"
"974",140,"of high wages had been sufficient to make clear to them the cruel fact"
"975",140,"that it was also a land of high prices, and that in it the poor man"
"976",140,"was almost as poor as in any other corner of the earth; and so there"
"977",140,"vanished in a night all the wonderful dreams of wealth that had been"
"978",140,"haunting Jurgis. What had made the discovery all the more painful was"
"979",140,"that they were spending, at American prices, money which they had earned"
"980",140,"at home rates of wages--and so were really being cheated by the world!"
"981",140,"The last two days they had all but starved themselves--it made them"
"982",140,"quite sick to pay the prices that the railroad people asked them for"
"983",140,"food."
"984",140,""
"985",140,"Yet, when they saw the home of the Widow Jukniene they could not but"
"986",140,"recoil, even so, in all their journey they had seen nothing so bad as"
"987",140,"this. Poni Aniele had a four-room flat in one of that wilderness of"
"988",140,"two-story frame tenements that lie ""back of the yards."" There were four"
"989",140,"such flats in each building, and each of the four was a ""boardinghouse"""
"990",140,"for the occupancy of foreigners--Lithuanians, Poles, Slovaks, or"
"991",140,"Bohemians. Some of these places were kept by private persons, some were"
"992",140,"cooperative. There would be an average of half a dozen boarders to each"
"993",140,"room--sometimes there were thirteen or fourteen to one room, fifty"
"994",140,"or sixty to a flat. Each one of the occupants furnished his own"
"995",140,"accommodations--that is, a mattress and some bedding. The mattresses"
"996",140,"would be spread upon the floor in rows--and there would be nothing else"
"997",140,"in the place except a stove. It was by no means unusual for two men"
"998",140,"to own the same mattress in common, one working by day and using it by"
"999",140,"night, and the other working at night and using it in the daytime. Very"
"1000",140,"frequently a lodging house keeper would rent the same beds to double"
"1001",140,"shifts of men."
"1002",140,""
"1003",140,"Mrs. Jukniene was a wizened-up little woman, with a wrinkled face. Her"
"1004",140,"home was unthinkably filthy; you could not enter by the front door at"
"1005",140,"all, owing to the mattresses, and when you tried to go up the backstairs"
"1006",140,"you found that she had walled up most of the porch with old boards"
"1007",140,"to make a place to keep her chickens. It was a standing jest of the"
"1008",140,"boarders that Aniele cleaned house by letting the chickens loose in"
"1009",140,"the rooms. Undoubtedly this did keep down the vermin, but it seemed"
"1010",140,"probable, in view of all the circumstances, that the old lady regarded"
"1011",140,"it rather as feeding the chickens than as cleaning the rooms. The truth"
"1012",140,"was that she had definitely given up the idea of cleaning anything,"
"1013",140,"under pressure of an attack of rheumatism, which had kept her doubled up"
"1014",140,"in one corner of her room for over a week; during which time eleven of"
"1015",140,"her boarders, heavily in her debt, had concluded to try their chances of"
"1016",140,"employment in Kansas City. This was July, and the fields were green. One"
"1017",140,"never saw the fields, nor any green thing whatever, in Packingtown; but"
"1018",140,"one could go out on the road and ""hobo it,"" as the men phrased it, and"
"1019",140,"see the country, and have a long rest, and an easy time riding on the"
"1020",140,"freight cars."
"1021",140,""
"1022",140,""
"1023",140,"Such was the home to which the new arrivals were welcomed. There was"
"1024",140,"nothing better to be had--they might not do so well by looking further,"
"1025",140,"for Mrs. Jukniene had at least kept one room for herself and her three"
"1026",140,"little children, and now offered to share this with the women and the"
"1027",140,"girls of the party. They could get bedding at a secondhand store,"
"1028",140,"she explained; and they would not need any, while the weather was so"
"1029",140,"hot--doubtless they would all sleep on the sidewalk such nights as this,"
"1030",140,"as did nearly all of her guests. ""Tomorrow,"" Jurgis said, when they were"
"1031",140,"left alone, ""tomorrow I will get a job, and perhaps Jonas will get one"
"1032",140,"also; and then we can get a place of our own."""
"1033",140,""
"1034",140,"Later that afternoon he and Ona went out to take a walk and look about"
"1035",140,"them, to see more of this district which was to be their home. In back"
"1036",140,"of the yards the dreary two-story frame houses were scattered farther"
"1037",140,"apart, and there were great spaces bare--that seemingly had been"
"1038",140,"overlooked by the great sore of a city as it spread itself over the"
"1039",140,"surface of the prairie. These bare places were grown up with dingy,"
"1040",140,"yellow weeds, hiding innumerable tomato cans; innumerable children"
"1041",140,"played upon them, chasing one another here and there, screaming and"
"1042",140,"fighting. The most uncanny thing about this neighborhood was the number"
"1043",140,"of the children; you thought there must be a school just out, and it was"
"1044",140,"only after long acquaintance that you were able to realize that"
"1045",140,"there was no school, but that these were the children of the"
"1046",140,"neighborhood--that there were so many children to the block in"
"1047",140,"Packingtown that nowhere on its streets could a horse and buggy move"
"1048",140,"faster than a walk!"
"1049",140,""
"1050",140,"It could not move faster anyhow, on account of the state of the streets."
"1051",140,"Those through which Jurgis and Ona were walking resembled streets less"
"1052",140,"than they did a miniature topographical map. The roadway was commonly"
"1053",140,"several feet lower than the level of the houses, which were sometimes"
"1054",140,"joined by high board walks; there were no pavements--there were"
"1055",140,"mountains and valleys and rivers, gullies and ditches, and great hollows"
"1056",140,"full of stinking green water. In these pools the children played, and"
"1057",140,"rolled about in the mud of the streets; here and there one noticed them"
"1058",140,"digging in it, after trophies which they had stumbled on. One wondered"
"1059",140,"about this, as also about the swarms of flies which hung about the"
"1060",140,"scene, literally blackening the air, and the strange, fetid odor which"
"1061",140,"assailed one's nostrils, a ghastly odor, of all the dead things of the"
"1062",140,"universe. It impelled the visitor to questions and then the residents"
"1063",140,"would explain, quietly, that all this was ""made"" land, and that it had"
"1064",140,"been ""made"" by using it as a dumping ground for the city garbage. After"
"1065",140,"a few years the unpleasant effect of this would pass away, it was said;"
"1066",140,"but meantime, in hot weather--and especially when it rained--the flies"
"1067",140,"were apt to be annoying. Was it not unhealthful? the stranger would ask,"
"1068",140,"and the residents would answer, ""Perhaps; but there is no telling."""
"1069",140,""
"1070",140,"A little way farther on, and Jurgis and Ona, staring open-eyed and"
"1071",140,"wondering, came to the place where this ""made"" ground was in process of"
"1072",140,"making. Here was a great hole, perhaps two city blocks square, and with"
"1073",140,"long files of garbage wagons creeping into it. The place had an odor"
"1074",140,"for which there are no polite words; and it was sprinkled over with"
"1075",140,"children, who raked in it from dawn till dark. Sometimes visitors from"
"1076",140,"the packing houses would wander out to see this ""dump,"" and they would"
"1077",140,"stand by and debate as to whether the children were eating the food they"
"1078",140,"got, or merely collecting it for the chickens at home. Apparently none"
"1079",140,"of them ever went down to find out."
"1080",140,""
"1081",140,"Beyond this dump there stood a great brickyard, with smoking chimneys."
"1082",140,"First they took out the soil to make bricks, and then they filled it"
"1083",140,"up again with garbage, which seemed to Jurgis and Ona a felicitous"
"1084",140,"arrangement, characteristic of an enterprising country like America. A"
"1085",140,"little way beyond was another great hole, which they had emptied and not"
"1086",140,"yet filled up. This held water, and all summer it stood there, with the"
"1087",140,"near-by soil draining into it, festering and stewing in the sun; and"
"1088",140,"then, when winter came, somebody cut the ice on it, and sold it to the"
"1089",140,"people of the city. This, too, seemed to the newcomers an economical"
"1090",140,"arrangement; for they did not read the newspapers, and their heads were"
"1091",140,"not full of troublesome thoughts about ""germs."""
"1092",140,""
"1093",140,"They stood there while the sun went down upon this scene, and the sky in"
"1094",140,"the west turned blood-red, and the tops of the houses shone like fire."
"1095",140,"Jurgis and Ona were not thinking of the sunset, however--their backs"
"1096",140,"were turned to it, and all their thoughts were of Packingtown, which"
"1097",140,"they could see so plainly in the distance. The line of the buildings"
"1098",140,"stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the"
"1099",140,"mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to"
"1100",140,"the end of the world. It was a study in colors now, this smoke; in the"
"1101",140,"sunset light it was black and brown and gray and purple. All the sordid"
"1102",140,"suggestions of the place were gone--in the twilight it was a vision of"
"1103",140,"power. To the two who stood watching while the darkness swallowed it up,"
"1104",140,"it seemed a dream of wonder, with its talc of human energy, of things"
"1105",140,"being done, of employment for thousands upon thousands of men, of"
"1106",140,"opportunity and freedom, of life and love and joy. When they came away,"

"1192",140,"cattle no one had ever dreamed existed in the world. Red cattle, black,"
"1193",140,"white, and yellow cattle; old cattle and young cattle; great bellowing"
"1194",140,"bulls and little calves not an hour born; meek-eyed milch cows and"
"1195",140,"fierce, long-horned Texas steers. The sound of them here was as of all"

"1199",140,"these gates was twenty-five thousand. Jokubas had recently been reading"
"1200",140,"a newspaper article which was full of statistics such as that, and he"
"1201",140,"was very proud as he repeated them and made his guests cry out with"
"1202",140,"wonder. Jurgis too had a little of this sense of pride. Had he not just"
"1203",140,"gotten a job, and become a sharer in all this activity, a cog in this"
"1204",140,"marvelous machine? Here and there about the alleys galloped men upon"
"1205",140,"horseback, booted, and carrying long whips; they were very busy, calling"
"1206",140,"to each other, and to those who were driving the cattle. They were"
"1207",140,"drovers and stock raisers, who had come from far states, and brokers and"
"1208",140,"commission merchants, and buyers for all the big packing houses."
"1209",140,""
"1210",140,"Here and there they would stop to inspect a bunch of cattle, and there"

"1217",140,"that they stood, and all along this east side of the yards ran the"
"1218",140,"railroad tracks, into which the cars were run, loaded with cattle."

"1231",140,"some eight or ten million live creatures turned into food every year."
"1232",140,"One stood and watched, and little by little caught the drift of the"
"1233",140,"tide, as it set in the direction of the packing houses. There were"
"1234",140,"groups of cattle being driven to the chutes, which were roadways about"
"1235",140,"fifteen feet wide, raised high above the pens. In these chutes the"
"1236",140,"stream of animals was continuous; it was quite uncanny to watch them,"
"1237",140,"pressing on to their fate, all unsuspicious a very river of death. Our"
"1238",140,"friends were not poetical, and the sight suggested to them no metaphors"
"1239",140,"of human destiny; they thought only of the wonderful efficiency of it"
"1240",140,"all. The chutes into which the hogs went climbed high up--to the very"
"1241",140,"top of the distant buildings; and Jokubas explained that the hogs went"
"1242",140,"up by the power of their own legs, and then their weight carried them"
"1243",140,"back through all the processes necessary to make them into pork."
"1244",140,""
"1245",140,"""They don't waste anything here,"" said the guide, and then he laughed"
"1246",140,"and added a witticism, which he was pleased that his unsophisticated"
"1247",140,"friends should take to be his own: ""They use everything about the hog"
"1248",140,"except the squeal."" In front of Brown's General Office building there"
"1249",140,"grows a tiny plot of grass, and this, you may learn, is the only bit"
"1250",140,"of green thing in Packingtown; likewise this jest about the hog and his"
"1251",140,"squeal, the stock in trade of all the guides, is the one gleam of humor"
"1252",140,"that you will find there."
"1253",140,""
"1254",140,"After they had seen enough of the pens, the party went up the street,"
"1255",140,"to the mass of buildings which occupy the center of the yards. These"
"1256",140,"buildings, made of brick and stained with innumerable layers of"
"1257",140,"Packingtown smoke, were painted all over with advertising signs, from"
"1258",140,"which the visitor realized suddenly that he had come to the home of many"
"1259",140,"of the torments of his life. It was here that they made those products"
"1260",140,"with the wonders of which they pestered him so--by placards that defaced"
"1261",140,"the landscape when he traveled, and by staring advertisements in the"
"1262",140,"newspapers and magazines--by silly little jingles that he could not get"
"1263",140,"out of his mind, and gaudy pictures that lurked for him around every"
"1264",140,"street corner. Here was where they made Brown's Imperial Hams and"
"1265",140,"Bacon, Brown's Dressed Beef, Brown's Excelsior Sausages! Here was the"
"1266",140,"headquarters of Durham's Pure Leaf Lard, of Durham's Breakfast Bacon,"
"1267",140,"Durham's Canned Beef, Potted Ham, Deviled Chicken, Peerless Fertilizer!"
"1268",140,""
"1269",140,"Entering one of the Durham buildings, they found a number of other"
"1270",140,"visitors waiting; and before long there came a guide, to escort them"
"1271",140,"through the place. They make a great feature of showing strangers"
"1272",140,"through the packing plants, for it is a good advertisement. But Ponas"
"1273",140,"Jokubas whispered maliciously that the visitors did not see any more"
"1274",140,"than the packers wanted them to. They climbed a long series of stairways"
"1275",140,"outside of the building, to the top of its five or six stories. Here was"
"1276",140,"the chute, with its river of hogs, all patiently toiling upward; there"
"1277",140,"was a place for them to rest to cool off, and then through another"
"1278",140,"passageway they went into a room from which there is no returning for"
"1279",140,"hogs."
"1280",140,""
"1281",140,"It was a long, narrow room, with a gallery along it for visitors. At the"
"1282",140,"head there was a great iron wheel, about twenty feet in circumference,"
"1283",140,"with rings here and there along its edge. Upon both sides of this wheel"
"1284",140,"there was a narrow space, into which came the hogs at the end of their"
"1285",140,"journey; in the midst of them stood a great burly Negro, bare-armed and"
"1286",140,"bare-chested. He was resting for the moment, for the wheel had stopped"
"1287",140,"while men were cleaning up. In a minute or two, however, it began slowly"
"1288",140,"to revolve, and then the men upon each side of it sprang to work. They"
"1289",140,"had chains which they fastened about the leg of the nearest hog, and the"
"1290",140,"other end of the chain they hooked into one of the rings upon the wheel."
"1291",140,"So, as the wheel turned, a hog was suddenly jerked off his feet and"
"1292",140,"borne aloft."
"1293",140,""
"1294",140,"At the same instant the car was assailed by a most terrifying shriek;"
"1295",140,"the visitors started in alarm, the women turned pale and shrank back."
"1296",140,"The shriek was followed by another, louder and yet more agonizing--for"
"1297",140,"once started upon that journey, the hog never came back; at the top of"
"1298",140,"the wheel he was shunted off upon a trolley, and went sailing down the"
"1299",140,"room. And meantime another was swung up, and then another, and another,"
"1300",140,"until there was a double line of them, each dangling by a foot and"
"1301",140,"kicking in frenzy--and squealing. The uproar was appalling, perilous"
"1302",140,"to the eardrums; one feared there was too much sound for the room to"
"1303",140,"hold--that the walls must give way or the ceiling crack. There were high"
"1304",140,"squeals and low squeals, grunts, and wails of agony; there would come a"
"1305",140,"momentary lull, and then a fresh outburst, louder than ever, surging up"
"1306",140,"to a deafening climax. It was too much for some of the visitors--the men"
"1307",140,"would look at each other, laughing nervously, and the women would stand"
"1308",140,"with hands clenched, and the blood rushing to their faces, and the tears"
"1309",140,"starting in their eyes."
"1310",140,""
"1311",140,"Meantime, heedless of all these things, the men upon the floor were"
"1312",140,"going about their work. Neither squeals of hogs nor tears of visitors"
"1313",140,"made any difference to them; one by one they hooked up the hogs, and"
"1314",140,"one by one with a swift stroke they slit their throats. There was a long"
"1315",140,"line of hogs, with squeals and lifeblood ebbing away together; until at"
"1316",140,"last each started again, and vanished with a splash into a huge vat of"
"1317",140,"boiling water."
"1318",140,""
"1319",140,"It was all so very businesslike that one watched it fascinated. It was"
"1320",140,"porkmaking by machinery, porkmaking by applied mathematics. And yet"
"1321",140,"somehow the most matter-of-fact person could not help thinking of the"
"1322",140,"hogs; they were so innocent, they came so very trustingly; and they were"
"1323",140,"so very human in their protests--and so perfectly within their rights!"
"1324",140,"They had done nothing to deserve it; and it was adding insult to injury,"
"1325",140,"as the thing was done here, swinging them up in this cold-blooded,"
"1326",140,"impersonal way, without a pretense of apology, without the homage of"
"1327",140,"a tear. Now and then a visitor wept, to be sure; but this slaughtering"
"1328",140,"machine ran on, visitors or no visitors. It was like some horrible crime"
"1329",140,"committed in a dungeon, all unseen and unheeded, buried out of sight and"
"1330",140,"of memory."
"1331",140,""
"1332",140,"One could not stand and watch very long without becoming philosophical,"
"1333",140,"without beginning to deal in symbols and similes, and to hear the hog"
"1334",140,"squeal of the universe. Was it permitted to believe that there was"
"1335",140,"nowhere upon the earth, or above the earth, a heaven for hogs, where"
"1336",140,"they were requited for all this suffering? Each one of these hogs was"
"1337",140,"a separate creature. Some were white hogs, some were black; some were"
"1338",140,"brown, some were spotted; some were old, some young; some were long and"
"1339",140,"lean, some were monstrous. And each of them had an individuality of his"
"1340",140,"own, a will of his own, a hope and a heart's desire; each was full"
"1341",140,"of self-confidence, of self-importance, and a sense of dignity. And"
"1342",140,"trusting and strong in faith he had gone about his business, the while a"
"1343",140,"black shadow hung over him and a horrid Fate waited in his pathway."
"1344",140,"Now suddenly it had swooped upon him, and had seized him by the leg."
"1345",140,"Relentless, remorseless, it was; all his protests, his screams, were"
"1346",140,"nothing to it--it did its cruel will with him, as if his wishes, his"
"1347",140,"feelings, had simply no existence at all; it cut his throat and watched"
"1348",140,"him gasp out his life. And now was one to believe that there was nowhere"
"1349",140,"a god of hogs, to whom this hog personality was precious, to whom these"
"1350",140,"hog squeals and agonies had a meaning? Who would take this hog into his"
"1351",140,"arms and comfort him, reward him for his work well done, and show him"
"1352",140,"the meaning of his sacrifice? Perhaps some glimpse of all this was in"
"1353",140,"the thoughts of our humble-minded Jurgis, as he turned to go on with the"
"1354",140,"rest of the party, and muttered: ""Dieve--but I'm glad I'm not a hog!"""
"1355",140,""
"1356",140,"The carcass hog was scooped out of the vat by machinery, and then it"
"1357",140,"fell to the second floor, passing on the way through a wonderful machine"
"1358",140,"with numerous scrapers, which adjusted themselves to the size and shape"
"1359",140,"of the animal, and sent it out at the other end with nearly all of its"
"1360",140,"bristles removed. It was then again strung up by machinery, and sent"
"1361",140,"upon another trolley ride; this time passing between two lines of men,"
"1362",140,"who sat upon a raised platform, each doing a certain single thing to"
"1363",140,"the carcass as it came to him. One scraped the outside of a leg; another"
"1364",140,"scraped the inside of the same leg. One with a swift stroke cut the"
"1365",140,"throat; another with two swift strokes severed the head, which fell"
"1366",140,"to the floor and vanished through a hole. Another made a slit down"
"1367",140,"the body; a second opened the body wider; a third with a saw cut the"
"1368",140,"breastbone; a fourth loosened the entrails; a fifth pulled them out--and"
"1369",140,"they also slid through a hole in the floor. There were men to scrape"
"1370",140,"each side and men to scrape the back; there were men to clean the"
"1371",140,"carcass inside, to trim it and wash it. Looking down this room, one saw,"
"1372",140,"creeping slowly, a line of dangling hogs a hundred yards in length; and"
"1373",140,"for every yard there was a man, working as if a demon were after him. At"
"1374",140,"the end of this hog's progress every inch of the carcass had been gone"
"1375",140,"over several times; and then it was rolled into the chilling room, where"
"1376",140,"it stayed for twenty-four hours, and where a stranger might lose himself"
"1377",140,"in a forest of freezing hogs."
"1378",140,""
"1379",140,"Before the carcass was admitted here, however, it had to pass a"
"1380",140,"government inspector, who sat in the doorway and felt of the glands in"
"1381",140,"the neck for tuberculosis. This government inspector did not have the"
"1382",140,"manner of a man who was worked to death; he was apparently not haunted"
"1383",140,"by a fear that the hog might get by him before he had finished his"
"1384",140,"testing. If you were a sociable person, he was quite willing to enter"
"1385",140,"into conversation with you, and to explain to you the deadly nature"
"1386",140,"of the ptomaines which are found in tubercular pork; and while he was"
"1387",140,"talking with you you could hardly be so ungrateful as to notice that a"
"1388",140,"dozen carcasses were passing him untouched. This inspector wore a blue"
"1389",140,"uniform, with brass buttons, and he gave an atmosphere of authority to"
"1390",140,"the scene, and, as it were, put the stamp of official approval upon the"
"1391",140,"things which were done in Durham's."
"1392",140,""
"1393",140,"Jurgis went down the line with the rest of the visitors, staring"
"1394",140,"open-mouthed, lost in wonder. He had dressed hogs himself in the forest"
"1395",140,"of Lithuania; but he had never expected to live to see one hog dressed"
"1396",140,"by several hundred men. It was like a wonderful poem to him, and he"
"1397",140,"took it all in guilelessly--even to the conspicuous signs demanding"
"1398",140,"immaculate cleanliness of the employees. Jurgis was vexed when the"
"1399",140,"cynical Jokubas translated these signs with sarcastic comments, offering"
"1400",140,"to take them to the secret rooms where the spoiled meats went to be"
"1401",140,"doctored."
"1402",140,""
"1403",140,"The party descended to the next floor, where the various waste materials"
"1404",140,"were treated. Here came the entrails, to be scraped and washed clean for"
"1405",140,"sausage casings; men and women worked here in the midst of a sickening"
"1406",140,"stench, which caused the visitors to hasten by, gasping. To another room"
"1407",140,"came all the scraps to be ""tanked,"" which meant boiling and pumping off"
"1408",140,"the grease to make soap and lard; below they took out the refuse, and"
"1409",140,"this, too, was a region in which the visitors did not linger. In still"
"1410",140,"other places men were engaged in cutting up the carcasses that had been"
"1411",140,"through the chilling rooms. First there were the ""splitters,"" the most"
"1412",140,"expert workmen in the plant, who earned as high as fifty cents an hour,"
"1413",140,"and did not a thing all day except chop hogs down the middle. Then there"
"1414",140,"were ""cleaver men,"" great giants with muscles of iron; each had two men"
"1415",140,"to attend him--to slide the half carcass in front of him on the table,"
"1416",140,"and hold it while he chopped it, and then turn each piece so that he"
"1417",140,"might chop it once more. His cleaver had a blade about two feet long,"
"1418",140,"and he never made but one cut; he made it so neatly, too, that his"
"1419",140,"implement did not smite through and dull itself--there was just enough"
"1420",140,"force for a perfect cut, and no more. So through various yawning"
"1421",140,"holes there slipped to the floor below--to one room hams, to another"
"1422",140,"forequarters, to another sides of pork. One might go down to this floor"
"1423",140,"and see the pickling rooms, where the hams were put into vats, and the"
"1424",140,"great smoke rooms, with their airtight iron doors. In other rooms they"
"1425",140,"prepared salt pork--there were whole cellars full of it, built up in"
"1426",140,"great towers to the ceiling. In yet other rooms they were putting up"
"1427",140,"meats in boxes and barrels, and wrapping hams and bacon in oiled paper,"
"1428",140,"sealing and labeling and sewing them. From the doors of these rooms went"
"1429",140,"men with loaded trucks, to the platform where freight cars were waiting"
"1430",140,"to be filled; and one went out there and realized with a start that he"
"1431",140,"had come at last to the ground floor of this enormous building."
"1432",140,""
"1433",140,"Then the party went across the street to where they did the killing"
"1434",140,"of beef--where every hour they turned four or five hundred cattle into"
"1435",140,"meat. Unlike the place they had left, all this work was done on one"
"1436",140,"floor; and instead of there being one line of carcasses which moved to"
"1437",140,"the workmen, there were fifteen or twenty lines, and the men moved"
"1438",140,"from one to another of these. This made a scene of intense activity, a"
"1439",140,"picture of human power wonderful to watch. It was all in one great room,"
"1440",140,"like a circus amphitheater, with a gallery for visitors running over the"
"1441",140,"center."
"1442",140,""
"1443",140,"Along one side of the room ran a narrow gallery, a few feet from the"
"1444",140,"floor; into which gallery the cattle were driven by men with goads which"
"1445",140,"gave them electric shocks. Once crowded in here, the creatures were"
"1446",140,"prisoned, each in a separate pen, by gates that shut, leaving them no"
"1447",140,"room to turn around; and while they stood bellowing and plunging, over"
"1448",140,"the top of the pen there leaned one of the ""knockers,"" armed with a"
"1449",140,"sledge hammer, and watching for a chance to deal a blow. The room echoed"
"1450",140,"with the thuds in quick succession, and the stamping and kicking of the"
"1451",140,"steers. The instant the animal had fallen, the ""knocker"" passed on to"
"1452",140,"another; while a second man raised a lever, and the side of the pen was"
"1453",140,"raised, and the animal, still kicking and struggling, slid out to"
"1454",140,"the ""killing bed."" Here a man put shackles about one leg, and pressed"
"1455",140,"another lever, and the body was jerked up into the air. There were"
"1456",140,"fifteen or twenty such pens, and it was a matter of only a couple of"
"1457",140,"minutes to knock fifteen or twenty cattle and roll them out. Then once"
"1458",140,"more the gates were opened, and another lot rushed in; and so out of"
"1459",140,"each pen there rolled a steady stream of carcasses, which the men upon"
"1460",140,"the killing beds had to get out of the way."
"1461",140,""
"1462",140,"The manner in which they did this was something to be seen and never"
"1463",140,"forgotten. They worked with furious intensity, literally upon the"
"1464",140,"run--at a pace with which there is nothing to be compared except a"
"1465",140,"football game. It was all highly specialized labor, each man having his"
"1466",140,"task to do; generally this would consist of only two or three specific"
"1467",140,"cuts, and he would pass down the line of fifteen or twenty carcasses,"
"1468",140,"making these cuts upon each. First there came the ""butcher,"" to bleed"
"1469",140,"them; this meant one swift stroke, so swift that you could not see"
"1470",140,"it--only the flash of the knife; and before you could realize it, the"
"1471",140,"man had darted on to the next line, and a stream of bright red was"
"1472",140,"pouring out upon the floor. This floor was half an inch deep with blood,"
"1473",140,"in spite of the best efforts of men who kept shoveling it through holes;"
"1474",140,"it must have made the floor slippery, but no one could have guessed this"
"1475",140,"by watching the men at work."
"1476",140,""
"1477",140,"The carcass hung for a few minutes to bleed; there was no time lost,"
"1478",140,"however, for there were several hanging in each line, and one was always"
"1479",140,"ready. It was let down to the ground, and there came the ""headsman,"""
"1480",140,"whose task it was to sever the head, with two or three swift strokes."
"1481",140,"Then came the ""floorsman,"" to make the first cut in the skin; and then"
"1482",140,"another to finish ripping the skin down the center; and then half a"
"1483",140,"dozen more in swift succession, to finish the skinning. After they were"
"1484",140,"through, the carcass was again swung up; and while a man with a stick"
"1485",140,"examined the skin, to make sure that it had not been cut, and another"
"1486",140,"rolled it up and tumbled it through one of the inevitable holes in the"
"1487",140,"floor, the beef proceeded on its journey. There were men to cut it, and"
"1488",140,"men to split it, and men to gut it and scrape it clean inside. There"
"1489",140,"were some with hose which threw jets of boiling water upon it, and"
"1490",140,"others who removed the feet and added the final touches. In the end, as"
"1491",140,"with the hogs, the finished beef was run into the chilling room, to hang"
"1492",140,"its appointed time."
"1493",140,""
"1494",140,"The visitors were taken there and shown them, all neatly hung in rows,"
"1495",140,"labeled conspicuously with the tags of the government inspectors--and"
"1496",140,"some, which had been killed by a special process, marked with the"
"1497",140,"sign of the kosher rabbi, certifying that it was fit for sale to the"
"1498",140,"orthodox. And then the visitors were taken to the other parts of the"
"1499",140,"building, to see what became of each particle of the waste material"
"1500",140,"that had vanished through the floor; and to the pickling rooms, and the"
"1501",140,"salting rooms, the canning rooms, and the packing rooms, where choice"
"1502",140,"meat was prepared for shipping in refrigerator cars, destined to be"
"1503",140,"eaten in all the four corners of civilization. Afterward they went"
"1504",140,"outside, wandering about among the mazes of buildings in which was done"
"1505",140,"the work auxiliary to this great industry. There was scarcely a"
"1506",140,"thing needed in the business that Durham and Company did not make for"
"1507",140,"themselves. There was a great steam power plant and an electricity"
"1508",140,"plant. There was a barrel factory, and a boiler-repair shop. There was a"
"1509",140,"building to which the grease was piped, and made into soap and lard; and"
"1510",140,"then there was a factory for making lard cans, and another for making"
"1511",140,"soap boxes. There was a building in which the bristles were cleaned"
"1512",140,"and dried, for the making of hair cushions and such things; there was a"
"1513",140,"building where the skins were dried and tanned, there was another where"
"1514",140,"heads and feet were made into glue, and another where bones were made"
"1515",140,"into fertilizer. No tiniest particle of organic matter was wasted in"
"1516",140,"Durham's. Out of the horns of the cattle they made combs, buttons,"
"1517",140,"hairpins, and imitation ivory; out of the shinbones and other big bones"
"1518",140,"they cut knife and toothbrush handles, and mouthpieces for pipes; out of"
"1519",140,"the hoofs they cut hairpins and buttons, before they made the rest into"
"1520",140,"glue. From such things as feet, knuckles, hide clippings, and sinews"
"1521",140,"came such strange and unlikely products as gelatin, isinglass,"
"1522",140,"and phosphorus, bone black, shoe blacking, and bone oil. They had"
"1523",140,"curled-hair works for the cattle tails, and a ""wool pullery"" for the"
"1524",140,"sheepskins; they made pepsin from the stomachs of the pigs, and albumen"
"1525",140,"from the blood, and violin strings from the ill-smelling entrails. When"
"1526",140,"there was nothing else to be done with a thing, they first put it into a"
"1527",140,"tank and got out of it all the tallow and grease, and then they made it"
"1528",140,"into fertilizer. All these industries were gathered into buildings near"
"1529",140,"by, connected by galleries and railroads with the main establishment;"
"1530",140,"and it was estimated that they had handled nearly a quarter of a"
"1531",140,"billion of animals since the founding of the plant by the elder Durham"
"1532",140,"a generation and more ago. If you counted with it the other big"
"1533",140,"plants--and they were now really all one--it was, so Jokubas informed"
"1534",140,"them, the greatest aggregation of labor and capital ever gathered in"
"1535",140,"one place. It employed thirty thousand men; it supported directly two"
"1536",140,"hundred and fifty thousand people in its neighborhood, and indirectly it"
"1537",140,"supported half a million. It sent its products to every country in"
"1538",140,"the civilized world, and it furnished the food for no less than thirty"
"1539",140,"million people!"
"1540",140,""
"1541",140,"To all of these things our friends would listen open-mouthed--it seemed"
"1542",140,"to them impossible of belief that anything so stupendous could have been"
"1543",140,"devised by mortal man. That was why to Jurgis it seemed almost profanity"
"1544",140,"to speak about the place as did Jokubas, skeptically; it was a thing"
"1545",140,"as tremendous as the universe--the laws and ways of its working no more"
"1546",140,"than the universe to be questioned or understood. All that a mere man"
"1547",140,"could do, it seemed to Jurgis, was to take a thing like this as he found"
"1548",140,"it, and do as he was told; to be given a place in it and a share in"
"1549",140,"its wonderful activities was a blessing to be grateful for, as one was"
"1550",140,"grateful for the sunshine and the rain. Jurgis was even glad that he had"
"1551",140,"not seen the place before meeting with his triumph, for he felt that the"
"1552",140,"size of it would have overwhelmed him. But now he had been admitted--he"
"1553",140,"was a part of it all! He had the feeling that this whole huge"
"1554",140,"establishment had taken him under its protection, and had become"
"1555",140,"responsible for his welfare. So guileless was he, and ignorant of the"
"1556",140,"nature of business, that he did not even realize that he had become an"
"1557",140,"employee of Brown's, and that Brown and Durham were supposed by all the"
"1558",140,"world to be deadly rivals--were even required to be deadly rivals by the"
"1559",140,"law of the land, and ordered to try to ruin each other under penalty of"
"1560",140,"fine and imprisonment!"

"1566",140,""
"1567",140,"Promptly at seven the next morning Jurgis reported for work. He came"
"1568",140,"to the door that had been pointed out to him, and there he waited for"
"1569",140,"nearly two hours. The boss had meant for him to enter, but had not said"
"1570",140,"this, and so it was only when on his way out to hire another man that"
"1571",140,"he came upon Jurgis. He gave him a good cursing, but as Jurgis did not"
"1572",140,"understand a word of it he did not object. He followed the boss, who"
"1573",140,"showed him where to put his street clothes, and waited while he donned"
"1574",140,"the working clothes he had bought in a secondhand shop and brought with"
"1575",140,"him in a bundle; then he led him to the ""killing beds."" The work which"
"1576",140,"Jurgis was to do here was very simple, and it took him but a few minutes"
"1577",140,"to learn it. He was provided with a stiff besom, such as is used by"
"1578",140,"street sweepers, and it was his place to follow down the line the man"
"1579",140,"who drew out the smoking entrails from the carcass of the steer; this"
"1580",140,"mass was to be swept into a trap, which was then closed, so that no one"
"1581",140,"might slip into it. As Jurgis came in, the first cattle of the morning"
"1582",140,"were just making their appearance; and so, with scarcely time to look"
"1583",140,"about him, and none to speak to any one, he fell to work. It was a"
"1584",140,"sweltering day in July, and the place ran with steaming hot blood--one"
"1585",140,"waded in it on the floor. The stench was almost overpowering, but to"
"1586",140,"Jurgis it was nothing. His whole soul was dancing with joy--he was at"
"1587",140,"work at last! He was at work and earning money! All day long he was"
"1588",140,"figuring to himself. He was paid the fabulous sum of seventeen and a"
"1589",140,"half cents an hour; and as it proved a rush day and he worked until"
"1590",140,"nearly seven o'clock in the evening, he went home to the family with"
"1591",140,"the tidings that he had earned more than a dollar and a half in a single"
"1592",140,"day!"
"1593",140,""
"1594",140,"At home, also, there was more good news; so much of it at once that"
"1595",140,"there was quite a celebration in Aniele's hall bedroom. Jonas had been"
"1596",140,"to have an interview with the special policeman to whom Szedvilas had"
"1597",140,"introduced him, and had been taken to see several of the bosses, with"
"1598",140,"the result that one had promised him a job the beginning of the next"
"1599",140,"week. And then there was Marija Berczynskas, who, fired with jealousy by"
"1600",140,"the success of Jurgis, had set out upon her own responsibility to get a"
"1601",140,"place. Marija had nothing to take with her save her two brawny arms"
"1602",140,"and the word ""job,"" laboriously learned; but with these she had marched"
"1603",140,"about Packingtown all day, entering every door where there were signs of"
"1604",140,"activity. Out of some she had been ordered with curses; but Marija was"
"1605",140,"not afraid of man or devil, and asked every one she saw--visitors and"
"1606",140,"strangers, or work-people like herself, and once or twice even high and"
"1607",140,"lofty office personages, who stared at her as if they thought she was"
"1608",140,"crazy. In the end, however, she had reaped her reward. In one of the"
"1609",140,"smaller plants she had stumbled upon a room where scores of women and"
"1610",140,"girls were sitting at long tables preparing smoked beef in cans; and"
"1611",140,"wandering through room after room, Marija came at last to the place"
"1612",140,"where the sealed cans were being painted and labeled, and here she had"
"1613",140,"the good fortune to encounter the ""forelady."" Marija did not understand"
"1614",140,"then, as she was destined to understand later, what there was attractive"
"1615",140,"to a ""forelady"" about the combination of a face full of boundless good"
"1616",140,"nature and the muscles of a dray horse; but the woman had told her to"
"1617",140,"come the next day and she would perhaps give her a chance to learn the"
"1618",140,"trade of painting cans. The painting of cans being skilled piecework,"
"1619",140,"and paying as much as two dollars a day, Marija burst in upon the family"
"1620",140,"with the yell of a Comanche Indian, and fell to capering about the room"
"1621",140,"so as to frighten the baby almost into convulsions."
"1622",140,""
"1623",140,"Better luck than all this could hardly have been hoped for; there was"
"1624",140,"only one of them left to seek a place. Jurgis was determined that Teta"
"1625",140,"Elzbieta should stay at home to keep house, and that Ona should help"
"1626",140,"her. He would not have Ona working--he was not that sort of a man, he"
"1627",140,"said, and she was not that sort of a woman. It would be a strange thing"
"1628",140,"if a man like him could not support the family, with the help of"
"1629",140,"the board of Jonas and Marija. He would not even hear of letting the"
"1630",140,"children go to work--there were schools here in America for children,"
"1631",140,"Jurgis had heard, to which they could go for nothing. That the priest"
"1632",140,"would object to these schools was something of which he had as yet no"
"1633",140,"idea, and for the present his mind was made up that the children of Teta"
"1634",140,"Elzbieta should have as fair a chance as any other children. The oldest"
"1635",140,"of them, little Stanislovas, was but thirteen, and small for his age"
"1636",140,"at that; and while the oldest son of Szedvilas was only twelve, and had"
"1637",140,"worked for over a year at Jones's, Jurgis would have it that Stanislovas"
"1638",140,"should learn to speak English, and grow up to be a skilled man."
"1639",140,""
"1640",140,"So there was only old Dede Antanas; Jurgis would have had him rest"
"1641",140,"too, but he was forced to acknowledge that this was not possible, and,"
"1642",140,"besides, the old man would not hear it spoken of--it was his whim to"
"1643",140,"insist that he was as lively as any boy. He had come to America as"
"1644",140,"full of hope as the best of them; and now he was the chief problem that"
"1645",140,"worried his son. For every one that Jurgis spoke to assured him that it"
"1646",140,"was a waste of time to seek employment for the old man in Packingtown."
"1647",140,"Szedvilas told him that the packers did not even keep the men who had"
"1648",140,"grown old in their own service--to say nothing of taking on new ones."
"1649",140,"And not only was it the rule here, it was the rule everywhere in"
"1650",140,"America, so far as he knew. To satisfy Jurgis he had asked the"
"1651",140,"policeman, and brought back the message that the thing was not to be"
"1652",140,"thought of. They had not told this to old Anthony, who had consequently"
"1653",140,"spent the two days wandering about from one part of the yards to"
"1654",140,"another, and had now come home to hear about the triumph of the others,"
"1655",140,"smiling bravely and saying that it would be his turn another day."
"1656",140,""
"1657",140,"Their good luck, they felt, had given them the right to think about a"
"1658",140,"home; and sitting out on the doorstep that summer evening, they held"
"1659",140,"consultation about it, and Jurgis took occasion to broach a weighty"
"1660",140,"subject. Passing down the avenue to work that morning he had seen two"
"1661",140,"boys leaving an advertisement from house to house; and seeing that there"
"1662",140,"were pictures upon it, Jurgis had asked for one, and had rolled it up"
"1663",140,"and tucked it into his shirt. At noontime a man with whom he had been"
"1664",140,"talking had read it to him and told him a little about it, with the"
"1665",140,"result that Jurgis had conceived a wild idea."
"1666",140,""
"1667",140,"He brought out the placard, which was quite a work of art. It was nearly"
"1668",140,"two feet long, printed on calendered paper, with a selection of colors"
"1669",140,"so bright that they shone even in the moonlight. The center of the"
"1670",140,"placard was occupied by a house, brilliantly painted, new, and dazzling."
"1671",140,"The roof of it was of a purple hue, and trimmed with gold; the house"
"1672",140,"itself was silvery, and the doors and windows red. It was a two-story"
"1673",140,"building, with a porch in front, and a very fancy scrollwork around the"
"1674",140,"edges; it was complete in every tiniest detail, even the doorknob, and"
"1675",140,"there was a hammock on the porch and white lace curtains in the windows."
"1676",140,"Underneath this, in one corner, was a picture of a husband and wife"
"1677",140,"in loving embrace; in the opposite corner was a cradle, with"
"1678",140,"fluffy curtains drawn over it, and a smiling cherub hovering upon"
"1679",140,"silver-colored wings. For fear that the significance of all this should"
"1680",140,"be lost, there was a label, in Polish, Lithuanian, and German--""Dom."
"1681",140,"Namai. Heim."" ""Why pay rent?"" the linguistic circular went on to demand."
"1682",140,"""Why not own your own home? Do you know that you can buy one for less"
"1683",140,"than your rent? We have built thousands of homes which are now occupied"
"1684",140,"by happy families.""--So it became eloquent, picturing the blissfulness"
"1685",140,"of married life in a house with nothing to pay. It even quoted ""Home,"
"1686",140,"Sweet Home,"" and made bold to translate it into Polish--though for some"
"1687",140,"reason it omitted the Lithuanian of this. Perhaps the translator found"
"1688",140,"it a difficult matter to be sentimental in a language in which a sob is"
"1689",140,"known as a gukcziojimas and a smile as a nusiszypsojimas."
"1690",140,""
"1691",140,"Over this document the family pored long, while Ona spelled out its"
"1692",140,"contents. It appeared that this house contained four rooms, besides a"
"1693",140,"basement, and that it might be bought for fifteen hundred dollars, the"
"1694",140,"lot and all. Of this, only three hundred dollars had to be paid down,"
"1695",140,"the balance being paid at the rate of twelve dollars a month. These were"
"1696",140,"frightful sums, but then they were in America, where people talked about"
"1697",140,"such without fear. They had learned that they would have to pay a"
"1698",140,"rent of nine dollars a month for a flat, and there was no way of doing"
"1699",140,"better, unless the family of twelve was to exist in one or two rooms, as"
"1700",140,"at present. If they paid rent, of course, they might pay forever, and be"
"1701",140,"no better off; whereas, if they could only meet the extra expense in the"
"1702",140,"beginning, there would at last come a time when they would not have any"
"1703",140,"rent to pay for the rest of their lives."
"1704",140,""
"1705",140,"They figured it up. There was a little left of the money belonging to"
"1706",140,"Teta Elzbieta, and there was a little left to Jurgis. Marija had about"
"1707",140,"fifty dollars pinned up somewhere in her stockings, and Grandfather"
"1708",140,"Anthony had part of the money he had gotten for his farm. If they all"
"1709",140,"combined, they would have enough to make the first payment; and if"
"1710",140,"they had employment, so that they could be sure of the future, it might"
"1711",140,"really prove the best plan. It was, of course, not a thing even to be"
"1712",140,"talked of lightly; it was a thing they would have to sift to the bottom."
"1713",140,"And yet, on the other hand, if they were going to make the venture, the"
"1714",140,"sooner they did it the better, for were they not paying rent all the"
"1715",140,"time, and living in a most horrible way besides? Jurgis was used to"
"1716",140,"dirt--there was nothing could scare a man who had been with a railroad"
"1717",140,"gang, where one could gather up the fleas off the floor of the sleeping"
"1718",140,"room by the handful. But that sort of thing would not do for Ona. They"
"1719",140,"must have a better place of some sort soon--Jurgis said it with all the"
"1720",140,"assurance of a man who had just made a dollar and fifty-seven cents in"
"1721",140,"a single day. Jurgis was at a loss to understand why, with wages as they"
"1722",140,"were, so many of the people of this district should live the way they"
"1723",140,"did."
"1724",140,""
"1725",140,"The next day Marija went to see her ""forelady,"" and was told to report"
"1726",140,"the first of the week, and learn the business of can-painter. Marija"
"1727",140,"went home, singing out loud all the way, and was just in time to join"
"1728",140,"Ona and her stepmother as they were setting out to go and make inquiry"
"1729",140,"concerning the house. That evening the three made their report to the"
"1730",140,"men--the thing was altogether as represented in the circular, or at any"
"1731",140,"rate so the agent had said. The houses lay to the south, about a mile"
"1732",140,"and a half from the yards; they were wonderful bargains, the gentleman"
"1733",140,"had assured them--personally, and for their own good. He could do this,"
"1734",140,"so he explained to them, for the reason that he had himself no interest"
"1735",140,"in their sale--he was merely the agent for a company that had built"
"1736",140,"them. These were the last, and the company was going out of business, so"
"1737",140,"if any one wished to take advantage of this wonderful no-rent plan, he"
"1738",140,"would have to be very quick. As a matter of fact there was just a little"
"1739",140,"uncertainty as to whether there was a single house left; for the agent"
"1740",140,"had taken so many people to see them, and for all he knew the company"
"1741",140,"might have parted with the last. Seeing Teta Elzbieta's evident grief at"
"1742",140,"this news, he added, after some hesitation, that if they really intended"
"1743",140,"to make a purchase, he would send a telephone message at his own"
"1744",140,"expense, and have one of the houses kept. So it had finally been"
"1745",140,"arranged--and they were to go and make an inspection the following"
"1746",140,"Sunday morning."
"1747",140,""
"1748",140,"That was Thursday; and all the rest of the week the killing gang"
"1749",140,"at Brown's worked at full pressure, and Jurgis cleared a dollar"
"1750",140,"seventy-five every day. That was at the rate of ten and one-half dollars"
"1751",140,"a week, or forty-five a month. Jurgis was not able to figure, except it"
"1752",140,"was a very simple sum, but Ona was like lightning at such things, and"
"1753",140,"she worked out the problem for the family. Marija and Jonas were each"
"1754",140,"to pay sixteen dollars a month board, and the old man insisted that he"
"1755",140,"could do the same as soon as he got a place--which might be any day now."
"1756",140,"That would make ninety-three dollars. Then Marija and Jonas were between"
"1757",140,"them to take a third share in the house, which would leave only eight"
"1758",140,"dollars a month for Jurgis to contribute to the payment. So they would"
"1759",140,"have eighty-five dollars a month--or, supposing that Dede Antanas did"
"1760",140,"not get work at once, seventy dollars a month--which ought surely to be"
"1761",140,"sufficient for the support of a family of twelve."
"1762",140,""
"1763",140,"An hour before the time on Sunday morning the entire party set out. They"
"1764",140,"had the address written on a piece of paper, which they showed to some"
"1765",140,"one now and then. It proved to be a long mile and a half, but they"
"1766",140,"walked it, and half an hour or so later the agent put in an appearance."
"1767",140,"He was a smooth and florid personage, elegantly dressed, and he spoke"
"1768",140,"their language freely, which gave him a great advantage in dealing with"
"1769",140,"them. He escorted them to the house, which was one of a long row of the"
"1770",140,"typical frame dwellings of the neighborhood, where architecture is a"
"1771",140,"luxury that is dispensed with. Ona's heart sank, for the house was not"
"1772",140,"as it was shown in the picture; the color scheme was different, for"
"1773",140,"one thing, and then it did not seem quite so big. Still, it was freshly"
"1774",140,"painted, and made a considerable show. It was all brand-new, so the"
"1775",140,"agent told them, but he talked so incessantly that they were quite"
"1776",140,"confused, and did not have time to ask many questions. There were all"
"1777",140,"sorts of things they had made up their minds to inquire about, but when"
"1778",140,"the time came, they either forgot them or lacked the courage. The other"
"1779",140,"houses in the row did not seem to be new, and few of them seemed to be"
"1780",140,"occupied. When they ventured to hint at this, the agent's reply was that"
"1781",140,"the purchasers would be moving in shortly. To press the matter would"
"1782",140,"have seemed to be doubting his word, and never in their lives had any"
"1783",140,"one of them ever spoken to a person of the class called ""gentleman"""
"1784",140,"except with deference and humility."
"1785",140,""
"1786",140,"The house had a basement, about two feet below the street line, and a"
"1787",140,"single story, about six feet above it, reached by a flight of steps. In"
"1788",140,"addition there was an attic, made by the peak of the roof, and having"
"1789",140,"one small window in each end. The street in front of the house was"
"1790",140,"unpaved and unlighted, and the view from it consisted of a few exactly"
"1791",140,"similar houses, scattered here and there upon lots grown up with dingy"
"1792",140,"brown weeds. The house inside contained four rooms, plastered white; the"
"1793",140,"basement was but a frame, the walls being unplastered and the floor not"
"1794",140,"laid. The agent explained that the houses were built that way, as the"
"1795",140,"purchasers generally preferred to finish the basements to suit their own"
"1796",140,"taste. The attic was also unfinished--the family had been figuring that"
"1797",140,"in case of an emergency they could rent this attic, but they found that"
"1798",140,"there was not even a floor, nothing but joists, and beneath them the"
"1799",140,"lath and plaster of the ceiling below. All of this, however, did not"
"1800",140,"chill their ardor as much as might have been expected, because of the"
"1801",140,"volubility of the agent. There was no end to the advantages of the"
"1802",140,"house, as he set them forth, and he was not silent for an instant; he"
"1803",140,"showed them everything, down to the locks on the doors and the catches"
"1804",140,"on the windows, and how to work them. He showed them the sink in the"
"1805",140,"kitchen, with running water and a faucet, something which Teta Elzbieta"
"1806",140,"had never in her wildest dreams hoped to possess. After a discovery such"
"1807",140,"as that it would have seemed ungrateful to find any fault, and so they"
"1808",140,"tried to shut their eyes to other defects."
"1809",140,""
"1810",140,"Still, they were peasant people, and they hung on to their money by"
"1811",140,"instinct; it was quite in vain that the agent hinted at promptness--they"
"1812",140,"would see, they would see, they told him, they could not decide until"
"1813",140,"they had had more time. And so they went home again, and all day and"
"1814",140,"evening there was figuring and debating. It was an agony to them to have"
"1815",140,"to make up their minds in a matter such as this. They never could agree"
"1816",140,"all together; there were so many arguments upon each side, and one would"
"1817",140,"be obstinate, and no sooner would the rest have convinced him than it"
"1818",140,"would transpire that his arguments had caused another to waver. Once, in"
"1819",140,"the evening, when they were all in harmony, and the house was as good as"
"1820",140,"bought, Szedvilas came in and upset them again. Szedvilas had no use for"
"1821",140,"property owning. He told them cruel stories of people who had been done"
"1822",140,"to death in this ""buying a home"" swindle. They would be almost sure to"
"1823",140,"get into a tight place and lose all their money; and there was no end"
"1824",140,"of expense that one could never foresee; and the house might be"
"1825",140,"good-for-nothing from top to bottom--how was a poor man to know? Then,"
"1826",140,"too, they would swindle you with the contract--and how was a poor man"
"1827",140,"to understand anything about a contract? It was all nothing but robbery,"
"1828",140,"and there was no safety but in keeping out of it. And pay rent? asked"
"1829",140,"Jurgis. Ah, yes, to be sure, the other answered, that too was robbery."
"1830",140,"It was all robbery, for a poor man. After half an hour of such"
"1831",140,"depressing conversation, they had their minds quite made up that they"
"1832",140,"had been saved at the brink of a precipice; but then Szedvilas went"
"1833",140,"away, and Jonas, who was a sharp little man, reminded them that the"
"1834",140,"delicatessen business was a failure, according to its proprietor, and"
"1835",140,"that this might account for his pessimistic views. Which, of course,"
"1836",140,"reopened the subject!"
"1837",140,""
"1838",140,"The controlling factor was that they could not stay where they"
"1839",140,"were--they had to go somewhere. And when they gave up the house plan and"
"1840",140,"decided to rent, the prospect of paying out nine dollars a month forever"
"1841",140,"they found just as hard to face. All day and all night for nearly a"
"1842",140,"whole week they wrestled with the problem, and then in the end Jurgis"
"1843",140,"took the responsibility. Brother Jonas had gotten his job, and was"
"1844",140,"pushing a truck in Durham's; and the killing gang at Brown's continued"
"1845",140,"to work early and late, so that Jurgis grew more confident every hour,"
"1846",140,"more certain of his mastership. It was the kind of thing the man of the"
"1847",140,"family had to decide and carry through, he told himself. Others might"
"1848",140,"have failed at it, but he was not the failing kind--he would show them"
"1849",140,"how to do it. He would work all day, and all night, too, if need be; he"
"1850",140,"would never rest until the house was paid for and his people had a home."
"1851",140,"So he told them, and so in the end the decision was made."
"1852",140,""
"1853",140,"They had talked about looking at more houses before they made the"
"1854",140,"purchase; but then they did not know where any more were, and they did"
"1855",140,"not know any way of finding out. The one they had seen held the sway in"
"1856",140,"their thoughts; whenever they thought of themselves in a house, it was"
"1857",140,"this house that they thought of. And so they went and told the agent"
"1858",140,"that they were ready to make the agreement. They knew, as an abstract"
"1859",140,"proposition, that in matters of business all men are to be accounted"
"1860",140,"liars; but they could not but have been influenced by all they had heard"
"1861",140,"from the eloquent agent, and were quite persuaded that the house was"
"1862",140,"something they had run a risk of losing by their delay. They drew a deep"
"1863",140,"breath when he told them that they were still in time."
"1864",140,""
"1865",140,"They were to come on the morrow, and he would have the papers all drawn"
"1866",140,"up. This matter of papers was one in which Jurgis understood to the full"
"1867",140,"the need of caution; yet he could not go himself--every one told him"
"1868",140,"that he could not get a holiday, and that he might lose his job by"
"1869",140,"asking. So there was nothing to be done but to trust it to the women,"
"1870",140,"with Szedvilas, who promised to go with them. Jurgis spent a whole"
"1871",140,"evening impressing upon them the seriousness of the occasion--and then"
"1872",140,"finally, out of innumerable hiding places about their persons and in"
"1873",140,"their baggage, came forth the precious wads of money, to be done up"
"1874",140,"tightly in a little bag and sewed fast in the lining of Teta Elzbieta's"
"1875",140,"dress."
"1876",140,""
"1877",140,"Early in the morning they sallied forth. Jurgis had given them so many"
"1878",140,"instructions and warned them against so many perils, that the women were"
"1879",140,"quite pale with fright, and even the imperturbable delicatessen vender,"
"1880",140,"who prided himself upon being a businessman, was ill at ease. The agent"
"1881",140,"had the deed all ready, and invited them to sit down and read it; this"
"1882",140,"Szedvilas proceeded to do--a painful and laborious process, during which"
"1883",140,"the agent drummed upon the desk. Teta Elzbieta was so embarrassed that"
"1884",140,"the perspiration came out upon her forehead in beads; for was not this"
"1885",140,"reading as much as to say plainly to the gentleman's face that they"
"1886",140,"doubted his honesty? Yet Jokubas Szedvilas read on and on; and presently"
"1887",140,"there developed that he had good reason for doing so. For a horrible"
"1888",140,"suspicion had begun dawning in his mind; he knitted his brows more and"
"1889",140,"more as he read. This was not a deed of sale at all, so far as he could"
"1890",140,"see--it provided only for the renting of the property! It was hard"
"1891",140,"to tell, with all this strange legal jargon, words he had never heard"
"1892",140,"before; but was not this plain--""the party of the first part hereby"
"1893",140,"covenants and agrees to rent to the said party of the second part!"" And"
"1894",140,"then again--""a monthly rental of twelve dollars, for a period of eight"
"1895",140,"years and four months!"" Then Szedvilas took off his spectacles, and"
"1896",140,"looked at the agent, and stammered a question."
"1897",140,""
"1898",140,"The agent was most polite, and explained that that was the usual"
"1899",140,"formula; that it was always arranged that the property should be merely"
"1900",140,"rented. He kept trying to show them something in the next paragraph; but"
"1901",140,"Szedvilas could not get by the word ""rental""--and when he translated it"
"1902",140,"to Teta Elzbieta, she too was thrown into a fright. They would not own"
"1903",140,"the home at all, then, for nearly nine years! The agent, with infinite"
"1904",140,"patience, began to explain again; but no explanation would do now."
"1905",140,"Elzbieta had firmly fixed in her mind the last solemn warning of Jurgis:"
"1906",140,"""If there is anything wrong, do not give him the money, but go out and"
"1907",140,"get a lawyer."" It was an agonizing moment, but she sat in the chair, her"
"1908",140,"hands clenched like death, and made a fearful effort, summoning all her"
"1909",140,"powers, and gasped out her purpose."
"1910",140,""
"1911",140,"Jokubas translated her words. She expected the agent to fly into a"
"1912",140,"passion, but he was, to her bewilderment, as ever imperturbable; he even"
"1913",140,"offered to go and get a lawyer for her, but she declined this. They went"
"1914",140,"a long way, on purpose to find a man who would not be a confederate."
"1915",140,"Then let any one imagine their dismay, when, after half an hour, they"
"1916",140,"came in with a lawyer, and heard him greet the agent by his first name!"
"1917",140,"They felt that all was lost; they sat like prisoners summoned to hear"
"1918",140,"the reading of their death warrant. There was nothing more that they"
"1919",140,"could do--they were trapped! The lawyer read over the deed, and when"
"1920",140,"he had read it he informed Szedvilas that it was all perfectly regular,"
"1921",140,"that the deed was a blank deed such as was often used in these sales."
"1922",140,"And was the price as agreed? the old man asked--three hundred dollars"
"1923",140,"down, and the balance at twelve dollars a month, till the total of"
"1924",140,"fifteen hundred dollars had been paid? Yes, that was correct. And it was"
"1925",140,"for the sale of such and such a house--the house and lot and everything?"
"1926",140,"Yes,--and the lawyer showed him where that was all written. And it was"
"1927",140,"all perfectly regular--there were no tricks about it of any sort? They"
"1928",140,"were poor people, and this was all they had in the world, and if there"
"1929",140,"was anything wrong they would be ruined. And so Szedvilas went on,"
"1930",140,"asking one trembling question after another, while the eyes of the women"
"1931",140,"folks were fixed upon him in mute agony. They could not understand what"
"1932",140,"he was saying, but they knew that upon it their fate depended. And when"
"1933",140,"at last he had questioned until there was no more questioning to be"
"1934",140,"done, and the time came for them to make up their minds, and either"
"1935",140,"close the bargain or reject it, it was all that poor Teta Elzbieta could"
"1936",140,"do to keep from bursting into tears. Jokubas had asked her if she wished"
"1937",140,"to sign; he had asked her twice--and what could she say? How did she"
"1938",140,"know if this lawyer were telling the truth--that he was not in the"
"1939",140,"conspiracy? And yet, how could she say so--what excuse could she give?"
"1940",140,"The eyes of every one in the room were upon her, awaiting her decision;"
"1941",140,"and at last, half blind with her tears, she began fumbling in her"
"1942",140,"jacket, where she had pinned the precious money. And she brought it out"
"1943",140,"and unwrapped it before the men. All of this Ona sat watching, from a"
"1944",140,"corner of the room, twisting her hands together, meantime, in a fever of"
"1945",140,"fright. Ona longed to cry out and tell her stepmother to stop, that it"
"1946",140,"was all a trap; but there seemed to be something clutching her by the"
"1947",140,"throat, and she could not make a sound. And so Teta Elzbieta laid the"
"1948",140,"money on the table, and the agent picked it up and counted it, and then"
"1949",140,"wrote them a receipt for it and passed them the deed. Then he gave a"
"1950",140,"sigh of satisfaction, and rose and shook hands with them all, still as"
"1951",140,"smooth and polite as at the beginning. Ona had a dim recollection of the"
"1952",140,"lawyer telling Szedvilas that his charge was a dollar, which occasioned"
"1953",140,"some debate, and more agony; and then, after they had paid that, too,"
"1954",140,"they went out into the street, her stepmother clutching the deed in her"
"1955",140,"hand. They were so weak from fright that they could not walk, but had to"
"1956",140,"sit down on the way."
"1957",140,""
"1958",140,"So they went home, with a deadly terror gnawing at their souls; and that"
"1959",140,"evening Jurgis came home and heard their story, and that was the end."
"1960",140,"Jurgis was sure that they had been swindled, and were ruined; and he"
"1961",140,"tore his hair and cursed like a madman, swearing that he would kill the"
"1962",140,"agent that very night. In the end he seized the paper and rushed out"
"1963",140,"of the house, and all the way across the yards to Halsted Street. He"
"1964",140,"dragged Szedvilas out from his supper, and together they rushed to"
"1965",140,"consult another lawyer. When they entered his office the lawyer"
"1966",140,"sprang up, for Jurgis looked like a crazy person, with flying hair and"
"1967",140,"bloodshot eyes. His companion explained the situation, and the lawyer"
"1968",140,"took the paper and began to read it, while Jurgis stood clutching the"
"1969",140,"desk with knotted hands, trembling in every nerve."
"1970",140,""
"1971",140,"Once or twice the lawyer looked up and asked a question of Szedvilas;"
"1972",140,"the other did not know a word that he was saying, but his eyes were"
"1973",140,"fixed upon the lawyer's face, striving in an agony of dread to read his"
"1974",140,"mind. He saw the lawyer look up and laugh, and he gave a gasp; the man"
"1975",140,"said something to Szedvilas, and Jurgis turned upon his friend, his"
"1976",140,"heart almost stopping."
"1977",140,""
"1978",140,"""Well?"" he panted."
"1979",140,""
"1980",140,"""He says it is all right,"" said Szedvilas."
"1981",140,""
"1982",140,"""All right!"""
"1983",140,""
"1984",140,"""Yes, he says it is just as it should be."" And Jurgis, in his relief,"
"1985",140,"sank down into a chair."
"1986",140,""
"1987",140,"""Are you sure of it?"" he gasped, and made Szedvilas translate question"
"1988",140,"after question. He could not hear it often enough; he could not ask"
"1989",140,"with enough variations. Yes, they had bought the house, they had really"
"1990",140,"bought it. It belonged to them, they had only to pay the money and it"
"1991",140,"would be all right. Then Jurgis covered his face with his hands, for"
"1992",140,"there were tears in his eyes, and he felt like a fool. But he had had"
"1993",140,"such a horrible fright; strong man as he was, it left him almost too"
"1994",140,"weak to stand up."
"1995",140,""
"1996",140,"The lawyer explained that the rental was a form--the property was said"
"1997",140,"to be merely rented until the last payment had been made, the purpose"
"1998",140,"being to make it easier to turn the party out if he did not make the"
"1999",140,"payments. So long as they paid, however, they had nothing to fear, the"
"2000",140,"house was all theirs."
"2001",140,""
"2002",140,"Jurgis was so grateful that he paid the half dollar the lawyer asked"
"2003",140,"without winking an eyelash, and then rushed home to tell the news to the"
"2004",140,"family. He found Ona in a faint and the babies screaming, and the whole"
"2005",140,"house in an uproar--for it had been believed by all that he had gone to"
"2006",140,"murder the agent. It was hours before the excitement could be calmed;"
"2007",140,"and all through that cruel night Jurgis would wake up now and then"
"2008",140,"and hear Ona and her stepmother in the next room, sobbing softly to"
"2009",140,"themselves."

"2015",140,""
"2016",140,"They had bought their home. It was hard for them to realize that the"
"2017",140,"wonderful house was theirs to move into whenever they chose. They spent"
"2018",140,"all their time thinking about it, and what they were going to put into"
"2019",140,"it. As their week with Aniele was up in three days, they lost no time"
"2020",140,"in getting ready. They had to make some shift to furnish it, and every"
"2021",140,"instant of their leisure was given to discussing this."
"2022",140,""
"2023",140,"A person who had such a task before him would not need to look very far"
"2024",140,"in Packingtown--he had only to walk up the avenue and read the signs,"
"2025",140,"or get into a streetcar, to obtain full information as to pretty much"
"2026",140,"everything a human creature could need. It was quite touching, the zeal"
"2027",140,"of people to see that his health and happiness were provided for. Did"
"2028",140,"the person wish to smoke? There was a little discourse about cigars,"
"2029",140,"showing him exactly why the Thomas Jefferson Five-cent Perfecto was the"
"2030",140,"only cigar worthy of the name. Had he, on the other hand, smoked too"
"2031",140,"much? Here was a remedy for the smoking habit, twenty-five doses for a"
"2032",140,"quarter, and a cure absolutely guaranteed in ten doses. In innumerable"
"2033",140,"ways such as this, the traveler found that somebody had been busied to"
"2034",140,"make smooth his paths through the world, and to let him know what had"
"2035",140,"been done for him. In Packingtown the advertisements had a style all"
"2036",140,"of their own, adapted to the peculiar population. One would be tenderly"
"2037",140,"solicitous. ""Is your wife pale?"" it would inquire. ""Is she discouraged,"
"2038",140,"does she drag herself about the house and find fault with everything?"
"2039",140,"Why do you not tell her to try Dr. Lanahan's Life Preservers?"" Another"
"2040",140,"would be jocular in tone, slapping you on the back, so to speak. ""Don't"
"2041",140,"be a chump!"" it would exclaim. ""Go and get the Goliath Bunion Cure."""
"2042",140,"""Get a move on you!"" would chime in another. ""It's easy, if you wear the"
"2043",140,"Eureka Two-fifty Shoe."""
"2044",140,""
"2045",140,"Among these importunate signs was one that had caught the attention"
"2046",140,"of the family by its pictures. It showed two very pretty little birds"
"2047",140,"building themselves a home; and Marija had asked an acquaintance to read"
"2048",140,"it to her, and told them that it related to the furnishing of a house."
"2049",140,"""Feather your nest,"" it ran--and went on to say that it could furnish"
"2050",140,"all the necessary feathers for a four-room nest for the ludicrously"
"2051",140,"small sum of seventy-five dollars. The particularly important thing"
"2052",140,"about this offer was that only a small part of the money need be had at"
"2053",140,"once--the rest one might pay a few dollars every month. Our friends had"
"2054",140,"to have some furniture, there was no getting away from that; but their"
"2055",140,"little fund of money had sunk so low that they could hardly get to sleep"
"2056",140,"at night, and so they fled to this as their deliverance. There was more"
"2057",140,"agony and another paper for Elzbieta to sign, and then one night when"
"2058",140,"Jurgis came home, he was told the breathless tidings that the furniture"
"2059",140,"had arrived and was safely stowed in the house: a parlor set of four"
"2060",140,"pieces, a bedroom set of three pieces, a dining room table and four"
"2061",140,"chairs, a toilet set with beautiful pink roses painted all over it,"
"2062",140,"an assortment of crockery, also with pink roses--and so on. One of the"
"2063",140,"plates in the set had been found broken when they unpacked it, and"
"2064",140,"Ona was going to the store the first thing in the morning to make them"
"2065",140,"change it; also they had promised three saucepans, and there had only"
"2066",140,"two come, and did Jurgis think that they were trying to cheat them?"
"2067",140,""
"2068",140,"The next day they went to the house; and when the men came from work"
"2069",140,"they ate a few hurried mouthfuls at Aniele's, and then set to work at"
"2070",140,"the task of carrying their belongings to their new home. The distance"
"2071",140,"was in reality over two miles, but Jurgis made two trips that night,"
"2072",140,"each time with a huge pile of mattresses and bedding on his head, with"
"2073",140,"bundles of clothing and bags and things tied up inside. Anywhere else"
"2074",140,"in Chicago he would have stood a good chance of being arrested; but the"
"2075",140,"policemen in Packingtown were apparently used to these informal movings,"
"2076",140,"and contented themselves with a cursory examination now and then. It was"
"2077",140,"quite wonderful to see how fine the house looked, with all the things in"
"2078",140,"it, even by the dim light of a lamp: it was really home, and almost as"
"2079",140,"exciting as the placard had described it. Ona was fairly dancing, and"
"2080",140,"she and Cousin Marija took Jurgis by the arm and escorted him from room"
"2081",140,"to room, sitting in each chair by turns, and then insisting that he"
"2082",140,"should do the same. One chair squeaked with his great weight, and they"
"2083",140,"screamed with fright, and woke the baby and brought everybody running."
"2084",140,"Altogether it was a great day; and tired as they were, Jurgis and Ona"
"2085",140,"sat up late, contented simply to hold each other and gaze in rapture"
"2086",140,"about the room. They were going to be married as soon as they could get"
"2087",140,"everything settled, and a little spare money put by; and this was to be"
"2088",140,"their home--that little room yonder would be theirs!"
"2089",140,""
"2090",140,"It was in truth a never-ending delight, the fixing up of this house."
"2091",140,"They had no money to spend for the pleasure of spending, but there"
"2092",140,"were a few absolutely necessary things, and the buying of these was a"
"2093",140,"perpetual adventure for Ona. It must always be done at night, so that"
"2094",140,"Jurgis could go along; and even if it were only a pepper cruet, or half"
"2095",140,"a dozen glasses for ten cents, that was enough for an expedition. On"
"2096",140,"Saturday night they came home with a great basketful of things, and"
"2097",140,"spread them out on the table, while every one stood round, and the"
"2098",140,"children climbed up on the chairs, or howled to be lifted up to see."
"2099",140,"There were sugar and salt and tea and crackers, and a can of lard and"
"2100",140,"a milk pail, and a scrubbing brush, and a pair of shoes for the second"
"2101",140,"oldest boy, and a can of oil, and a tack hammer, and a pound of nails."
"2102",140,"These last were to be driven into the walls of the kitchen and the"
"2103",140,"bedrooms, to hang things on; and there was a family discussion as to the"
"2104",140,"place where each one was to be driven. Then Jurgis would try to hammer,"
"2105",140,"and hit his fingers because the hammer was too small, and get mad"
"2106",140,"because Ona had refused to let him pay fifteen cents more and get a"
"2107",140,"bigger hammer; and Ona would be invited to try it herself, and hurt"
"2108",140,"her thumb, and cry out, which necessitated the thumb's being kissed"
"2109",140,"by Jurgis. Finally, after every one had had a try, the nails would be"
"2110",140,"driven, and something hung up. Jurgis had come home with a big packing"
"2111",140,"box on his head, and he sent Jonas to get another that he had bought. He"
"2112",140,"meant to take one side out of these tomorrow, and put shelves in them,"
"2113",140,"and make them into bureaus and places to keep things for the bedrooms."
"2114",140,"The nest which had been advertised had not included feathers for quite"
"2115",140,"so many birds as there were in this family."
"2116",140,""
"2117",140,"They had, of course, put their dining table in the kitchen, and the"
"2118",140,"dining room was used as the bedroom of Teta Elzbieta and five of her"
"2119",140,"children. She and the two youngest slept in the only bed, and the other"
"2120",140,"three had a mattress on the floor. Ona and her cousin dragged a mattress"
"2121",140,"into the parlor and slept at night, and the three men and the oldest boy"
"2122",140,"slept in the other room, having nothing but the very level floor to"
"2123",140,"rest on for the present. Even so, however, they slept soundly--it was"
"2124",140,"necessary for Teta Elzbieta to pound more than once on the door at a quarter"
"2125",140,"past five every morning. She would have ready a great pot full of"
"2126",140,"steaming black coffee, and oatmeal and bread and smoked sausages; and"
"2127",140,"then she would fix them their dinner pails with more thick slices of"
"2128",140,"bread with lard between them--they could not afford butter--and some"
"2129",140,"onions and a piece of cheese, and so they would tramp away to work."
"2130",140,""
"2131",140,"This was the first time in his life that he had ever really worked, it"
"2132",140,"seemed to Jurgis; it was the first time that he had ever had anything"
"2133",140,"to do which took all he had in him. Jurgis had stood with the rest up in"
"2134",140,"the gallery and watched the men on the killing beds, marveling at their"
"2135",140,"speed and power as if they had been wonderful machines; it somehow never"
"2136",140,"occurred to one to think of the flesh-and-blood side of it--that is, not"
"2137",140,"until he actually got down into the pit and took off his coat. Then he"
"2138",140,"saw things in a different light, he got at the inside of them. The pace"
"2139",140,"they set here, it was one that called for every faculty of a man--from"
"2140",140,"the instant the first steer fell till the sounding of the noon whistle,"
"2141",140,"and again from half-past twelve till heaven only knew what hour in the"
"2142",140,"late afternoon or evening, there was never one instant's rest for a man,"
"2143",140,"for his hand or his eye or his brain. Jurgis saw how they managed it;"
"2144",140,"there were portions of the work which determined the pace of the rest,"
"2145",140,"and for these they had picked men whom they paid high wages, and whom"
"2146",140,"they changed frequently. You might easily pick out these pacemakers,"
"2147",140,"for they worked under the eye of the bosses, and they worked like men"
"2148",140,"possessed. This was called ""speeding up the gang,"" and if any man could"
"2149",140,"not keep up with the pace, there were hundreds outside begging to try."
"2150",140,""
"2151",140,"Yet Jurgis did not mind it; he rather enjoyed it. It saved him the"
"2152",140,"necessity of flinging his arms about and fidgeting as he did in most"
"2153",140,"work. He would laugh to himself as he ran down the line, darting a"
"2154",140,"glance now and then at the man ahead of him. It was not the pleasantest"
"2155",140,"work one could think of, but it was necessary work; and what more had"
"2156",140,"a man the right to ask than a chance to do something useful, and to get"
"2157",140,"good pay for doing it?"
"2158",140,""
"2159",140,"So Jurgis thought, and so he spoke, in his bold, free way; very much to"
"2160",140,"his surprise, he found that it had a tendency to get him into trouble."
"2161",140,"For most of the men here took a fearfully different view of the thing."
"2162",140,"He was quite dismayed when he first began to find it out--that most of"
"2163",140,"the men hated their work. It seemed strange, it was even terrible,"
"2164",140,"when you came to find out the universality of the sentiment; but it was"
"2165",140,"certainly the fact--they hated their work. They hated the bosses"
"2166",140,"and they hated the owners; they hated the whole place, the whole"
"2167",140,"neighborhood--even the whole city, with an all-inclusive hatred, bitter"
"2168",140,"and fierce. Women and little children would fall to cursing about it; it"
"2169",140,"was rotten, rotten as hell--everything was rotten. When Jurgis would ask"
"2170",140,"them what they meant, they would begin to get suspicious, and content"
"2171",140,"themselves with saying, ""Never mind, you stay here and see for"
"2172",140,"yourself."""
"2173",140,""
"2174",140,"One of the first problems that Jurgis ran upon was that of the unions."
"2175",140,"He had had no experience with unions, and he had to have it explained"
"2176",140,"to him that the men were banded together for the purpose of fighting"
"2177",140,"for their rights. Jurgis asked them what they meant by their rights, a"
"2178",140,"question in which he was quite sincere, for he had not any idea of any"
"2179",140,"rights that he had, except the right to hunt for a job, and do as he was"
"2180",140,"told when he got it. Generally, however, this harmless question would"
"2181",140,"only make his fellow workingmen lose their tempers and call him a fool."
"2182",140,"There was a delegate of the butcher-helpers' union who came to see"
"2183",140,"Jurgis to enroll him; and when Jurgis found that this meant that he"
"2184",140,"would have to part with some of his money, he froze up directly, and the"
"2185",140,"delegate, who was an Irishman and only knew a few words of Lithuanian,"
"2186",140,"lost his temper and began to threaten him. In the end Jurgis got into a"
"2187",140,"fine rage, and made it sufficiently plain that it would take more than"
"2188",140,"one Irishman to scare him into a union. Little by little he gathered"
"2189",140,"that the main thing the men wanted was to put a stop to the habit of"
"2190",140,"""speeding-up""; they were trying their best to force a lessening of the"
"2191",140,"pace, for there were some, they said, who could not keep up with it,"
"2192",140,"whom it was killing. But Jurgis had no sympathy with such ideas as"
"2193",140,"this--he could do the work himself, and so could the rest of them, he"
"2194",140,"declared, if they were good for anything. If they couldn't do it, let"
"2195",140,"them go somewhere else. Jurgis had not studied the books, and he would"
"2196",140,"not have known how to pronounce ""laissez faire""; but he had been round"
"2197",140,"the world enough to know that a man has to shift for himself in it,"
"2198",140,"and that if he gets the worst of it, there is nobody to listen to him"
"2199",140,"holler."
"2200",140,""
"2201",140,"Yet there have been known to be philosophers and plain men who swore"
"2202",140,"by Malthus in the books, and would, nevertheless, subscribe to a relief"
"2203",140,"fund in time of a famine. It was the same with Jurgis, who consigned the"
"2204",140,"unfit to destruction, while going about all day sick at heart because"
"2205",140,"of his poor old father, who was wandering somewhere in the yards begging"
"2206",140,"for a chance to earn his bread. Old Antanas had been a worker ever since"
"2207",140,"he was a child; he had run away from home when he was twelve, because"
"2208",140,"his father beat him for trying to learn to read. And he was a faithful"
"2209",140,"man, too; he was a man you might leave alone for a month, if only you"
"2210",140,"had made him understand what you wanted him to do in the meantime. And"
"2211",140,"now here he was, worn out in soul and body, and with no more place in"
"2212",140,"the world than a sick dog. He had his home, as it happened, and some one"
"2213",140,"who would care for him if he never got a job; but his son could not help"
"2214",140,"thinking, suppose this had not been the case. Antanas Rudkus had been"
"2215",140,"into every building in Packingtown by this time, and into nearly every"
"2216",140,"room; he had stood mornings among the crowd of applicants till the very"
"2217",140,"policemen had come to know his face and to tell him to go home and give"
"2218",140,"it up. He had been likewise to all the stores and saloons for a mile"
"2219",140,"about, begging for some little thing to do; and everywhere they had"
"2220",140,"ordered him out, sometimes with curses, and not once even stopping to"
"2221",140,"ask him a question."
"2222",140,""
"2223",140,"So, after all, there was a crack in the fine structure of Jurgis' faith"
"2224",140,"in things as they are. The crack was wide while Dede Antanas was hunting"
"2225",140,"a job--and it was yet wider when he finally got it. For one evening the"
"2226",140,"old man came home in a great state of excitement, with the tale that he"
"2227",140,"had been approached by a man in one of the corridors of the pickle rooms"
"2228",140,"of Durham's, and asked what he would pay to get a job. He had not"
"2229",140,"known what to make of this at first; but the man had gone on with"
"2230",140,"matter-of-fact frankness to say that he could get him a job, provided"
"2231",140,"that he were willing to pay one-third of his wages for it. Was he a"
"2232",140,"boss? Antanas had asked; to which the man had replied that that was"
"2233",140,"nobody's business, but that he could do what he said."
"2234",140,""
"2235",140,"Jurgis had made some friends by this time, and he sought one of them and"
"2236",140,"asked what this meant. The friend, who was named Tamoszius Kuszleika,"
"2237",140,"was a sharp little man who folded hides on the killing beds, and he"
"2238",140,"listened to what Jurgis had to say without seeming at all surprised."
"2239",140,"They were common enough, he said, such cases of petty graft. It was"
"2240",140,"simply some boss who proposed to add a little to his income. After"
"2241",140,"Jurgis had been there awhile he would know that the plants were simply"
"2242",140,"honeycombed with rottenness of that sort--the bosses grafted off the"
"2243",140,"men, and they grafted off each other; and some day the superintendent"
"2244",140,"would find out about the boss, and then he would graft off the boss."
"2245",140,"Warming to the subject, Tamoszius went on to explain the situation. Here"
"2246",140,"was Durham's, for instance, owned by a man who was trying to make as"
"2247",140,"much money out of it as he could, and did not care in the least how he"
"2248",140,"did it; and underneath him, ranged in ranks and grades like an army,"
"2249",140,"were managers and superintendents and foremen, each one driving the"
"2250",140,"man next below him and trying to squeeze out of him as much work as"
"2251",140,"possible. And all the men of the same rank were pitted against each"
"2252",140,"other; the accounts of each were kept separately, and every man lived"
"2253",140,"in terror of losing his job, if another made a better record than he. So"
"2254",140,"from top to bottom the place was simply a seething caldron of jealousies"
"2255",140,"and hatreds; there was no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there"
"2256",140,"was no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar."
"2257",140,"And worse than there being no decency, there was not even any honesty."
"2258",140,"The reason for that? Who could say? It must have been old Durham in the"
"2259",140,"beginning; it was a heritage which the self-made merchant had left to"
"2260",140,"his son, along with his millions."
"2261",140,""
"2262",140,"Jurgis would find out these things for himself, if he stayed there long"
"2263",140,"enough; it was the men who had to do all the dirty jobs, and so there"
"2264",140,"was no deceiving them; and they caught the spirit of the place, and did"
"2265",140,"like all the rest. Jurgis had come there, and thought he was going to"
"2266",140,"make himself useful, and rise and become a skilled man; but he would"
"2267",140,"soon find out his error--for nobody rose in Packingtown by doing good"
"2268",140,"work. You could lay that down for a rule--if you met a man who was"
"2269",140,"rising in Packingtown, you met a knave. That man who had been sent to"
"2270",140,"Jurgis' father by the boss, he would rise; the man who told tales"
"2271",140,"and spied upon his fellows would rise; but the man who minded his own"
"2272",140,"business and did his work--why, they would ""speed him up"" till they had"
"2273",140,"worn him out, and then they would throw him into the gutter."
"2274",140,""
"2275",140,"Jurgis went home with his head buzzing. Yet he could not bring himself"
"2276",140,"to believe such things--no, it could not be so. Tamoszius was simply"
"2277",140,"another of the grumblers. He was a man who spent all his time fiddling;"
"2278",140,"and he would go to parties at night and not get home till sunrise, and"
"2279",140,"so of course he did not feel like work. Then, too, he was a puny little"
"2280",140,"chap; and so he had been left behind in the race, and that was why he"
"2281",140,"was sore. And yet so many strange things kept coming to Jurgis' notice"
"2282",140,"every day!"
"2283",140,""
"2284",140,"He tried to persuade his father to have nothing to do with the offer."
"2285",140,"But old Antanas had begged until he was worn out, and all his courage"
"2286",140,"was gone; he wanted a job, any sort of a job. So the next day he went"
"2287",140,"and found the man who had spoken to him, and promised to bring him a"
"2288",140,"third of all he earned; and that same day he was put to work in Durham's"
"2289",140,"cellars. It was a ""pickle room,"" where there was never a dry spot to"
"2290",140,"stand upon, and so he had to take nearly the whole of his first week's"
"2291",140,"earnings to buy him a pair of heavy-soled boots. He was a ""squeedgie"""
"2292",140,"man; his job was to go about all day with a long-handled mop, swabbing"
"2293",140,"up the floor. Except that it was damp and dark, it was not an unpleasant"
"2294",140,"job, in summer."
"2295",140,""
"2296",140,"Now Antanas Rudkus was the meekest man that God ever put on earth; and"
"2297",140,"so Jurgis found it a striking confirmation of what the men all said,"
"2298",140,"that his father had been at work only two days before he came home as"
"2299",140,"bitter as any of them, and cursing Durham's with all the power of his"
"2300",140,"soul. For they had set him to cleaning out the traps; and the family"
"2301",140,"sat round and listened in wonder while he told them what that meant. It"
"2302",140,"seemed that he was working in the room where the men prepared the beef"
"2303",140,"for canning, and the beef had lain in vats full of chemicals, and men"
"2304",140,"with great forks speared it out and dumped it into trucks, to be taken"
"2305",140,"to the cooking room. When they had speared out all they could reach,"
"2306",140,"they emptied the vat on the floor, and then with shovels scraped up the"
"2307",140,"balance and dumped it into the truck. This floor was filthy, yet"
"2308",140,"they set Antanas with his mop slopping the ""pickle"" into a hole that"
"2309",140,"connected with a sink, where it was caught and used over again forever;"
"2310",140,"and if that were not enough, there was a trap in the pipe, where all the"
"2311",140,"scraps of meat and odds and ends of refuse were caught, and every few"
"2312",140,"days it was the old man's task to clean these out, and shovel their"
"2313",140,"contents into one of the trucks with the rest of the meat!"
"2314",140,""
"2315",140,"This was the experience of Antanas; and then there came also Jonas and"
"2316",140,"Marija with tales to tell. Marija was working for one of the independent"
"2317",140,"packers, and was quite beside herself and outrageous with triumph over"
"2318",140,"the sums of money she was making as a painter of cans. But one day she"
"2319",140,"walked home with a pale-faced little woman who worked opposite to her,"
"2320",140,"Jadvyga Marcinkus by name, and Jadvyga told her how she, Marija, had"
"2321",140,"chanced to get her job. She had taken the place of an Irishwoman who had"
"2322",140,"been working in that factory ever since any one could remember. For over"
"2323",140,"fifteen years, so she declared. Mary Dennis was her name, and a long"
"2324",140,"time ago she had been seduced, and had a little boy; he was a cripple,"
"2325",140,"and an epileptic, but still he was all that she had in the world to"
"2326",140,"love, and they had lived in a little room alone somewhere back of"
"2327",140,"Halsted Street, where the Irish were. Mary had had consumption, and all"
"2328",140,"day long you might hear her coughing as she worked; of late she had been"
"2329",140,"going all to pieces, and when Marija came, the ""forelady"" had suddenly"
"2330",140,"decided to turn her off. The forelady had to come up to a certain"
"2331",140,"standard herself, and could not stop for sick people, Jadvyga explained."
"2332",140,"The fact that Mary had been there so long had not made any difference"
"2333",140,"to her--it was doubtful if she even knew that, for both the forelady and"
"2334",140,"the superintendent were new people, having only been there two or three"
"2335",140,"years themselves. Jadvyga did not know what had become of the poor"
"2336",140,"creature; she would have gone to see her, but had been sick herself. She"
"2337",140,"had pains in her back all the time, Jadvyga explained, and feared"
"2338",140,"that she had womb trouble. It was not fit work for a woman, handling"
"2339",140,"fourteen-pound cans all day."
"2340",140,""
"2341",140,"It was a striking circumstance that Jonas, too, had gotten his job by"
"2342",140,"the misfortune of some other person. Jonas pushed a truck loaded with"
"2343",140,"hams from the smoke rooms on to an elevator, and thence to the packing"
"2344",140,"rooms. The trucks were all of iron, and heavy, and they put about"
"2345",140,"threescore hams on each of them, a load of more than a quarter of a"
"2346",140,"ton. On the uneven floor it was a task for a man to start one of these"
"2347",140,"trucks, unless he was a giant; and when it was once started he naturally"
"2348",140,"tried his best to keep it going. There was always the boss prowling"
"2349",140,"about, and if there was a second's delay he would fall to cursing;"
"2350",140,"Lithuanians and Slovaks and such, who could not understand what was said"
"2351",140,"to them, the bosses were wont to kick about the place like so many"
"2352",140,"dogs. Therefore these trucks went for the most part on the run; and the"
"2353",140,"predecessor of Jonas had been jammed against the wall by one and crushed"
"2354",140,"in a horrible and nameless manner."
"2355",140,""
"2356",140,"All of these were sinister incidents; but they were trifles compared to"
"2357",140,"what Jurgis saw with his own eyes before long. One curious thing he"
"2358",140,"had noticed, the very first day, in his profession of shoveler of guts;"
"2359",140,"which was the sharp trick of the floor bosses whenever there chanced to"
"2360",140,"come a ""slunk"" calf. Any man who knows anything about butchering knows"
"2361",140,"that the flesh of a cow that is about to calve, or has just calved, is"
"2362",140,"not fit for food. A good many of these came every day to the packing"
"2363",140,"houses--and, of course, if they had chosen, it would have been an easy"
"2364",140,"matter for the packers to keep them till they were fit for food. But"
"2365",140,"for the saving of time and fodder, it was the law that cows of that sort"
"2366",140,"came along with the others, and whoever noticed it would tell the"
"2367",140,"boss, and the boss would start up a conversation with the government"
"2368",140,"inspector, and the two would stroll away. So in a trice the carcass of"
"2369",140,"the cow would be cleaned out, and entrails would have vanished; it was"
"2370",140,"Jurgis' task to slide them into the trap, calves and all, and on the"
"2371",140,"floor below they took out these ""slunk"" calves, and butchered them for"
"2372",140,"meat, and used even the skins of them."
"2373",140,""
"2374",140,"One day a man slipped and hurt his leg; and that afternoon, when the"
"2375",140,"last of the cattle had been disposed of, and the men were leaving,"
"2376",140,"Jurgis was ordered to remain and do some special work which this injured"
"2377",140,"man had usually done. It was late, almost dark, and the government"
"2378",140,"inspectors had all gone, and there were only a dozen or two of men on"
"2379",140,"the floor. That day they had killed about four thousand cattle, and"
"2380",140,"these cattle had come in freight trains from far states, and some of"
"2381",140,"them had got hurt. There were some with broken legs, and some with gored"
"2382",140,"sides; there were some that had died, from what cause no one could"
"2383",140,"say; and they were all to be disposed of, here in darkness and silence."
"2384",140,"""Downers,"" the men called them; and the packing house had a special"
"2385",140,"elevator upon which they were raised to the killing beds, where the gang"
"2386",140,"proceeded to handle them, with an air of businesslike nonchalance which"
"2387",140,"said plainer than any words that it was a matter of everyday routine. It"
"2388",140,"took a couple of hours to get them out of the way, and in the end Jurgis"
"2389",140,"saw them go into the chilling rooms with the rest of the meat, being"
"2390",140,"carefully scattered here and there so that they could not be identified."
"2391",140,"When he came home that night he was in a very somber mood, having begun"

"2400",140,"Jurgis and Ona were very much in love; they had waited a long time--it"
"2401",140,"was now well into the second year, and Jurgis judged everything by the"
"2402",140,"criterion of its helping or hindering their union. All his thoughts were"
"2403",140,"there; he accepted the family because it was a part of Ona. And he was"
"2404",140,"interested in the house because it was to be Ona's home. Even the tricks"

"2409",140,"this would mean that they would have to do without any wedding feast,"

"2411",140,"people. To Teta Elzbieta especially the very suggestion was an"
"2412",140,"affliction. What! she would cry. To be married on the roadside like a"
"2413",140,"parcel of beggars! No! No!--Elzbieta had some traditions behind her;"
"2414",140,"she had been a person of importance in her girlhood--had lived on a big"
"2415",140,"estate and had servants, and might have married well and been a lady,"
"2416",140,"but for the fact that there had been nine daughters and no sons in the"
"2417",140,"family. Even so, however, she knew what was decent, and clung to her"
"2418",140,"traditions with desperation. They were not going to lose all caste, even"
"2419",140,"if they had come to be unskilled laborers in Packingtown; and that Ona"
"2420",140,"had even talked of omitting a _veselija_ was enough to keep her stepmother"
"2421",140,"lying awake all night. It was in vain for them to say that they had"
"2422",140,"so few friends; they were bound to have friends in time, and then the"
"2423",140,"friends would talk about it. They must not give up what was right for a"
"2424",140,"little money--if they did, the money would never do them any good, they"
"2425",140,"could depend upon that. And Elzbieta would call upon Dede Antanas to"
"2426",140,"support her; there was a fear in the souls of these two, lest this"
"2427",140,"journey to a new country might somehow undermine the old home virtues of"
"2428",140,"their children. The very first Sunday they had all been taken to mass;"

"2430",140,"of her resources in a representation of the babe of Bethlehem, made"
"2431",140,"in plaster, and painted in brilliant colors. Though it was only a foot"
"2432",140,"high, there was a shrine with four snow-white steeples, and the Virgin"
"2433",140,"standing with her child in her arms, and the kings and shepherds and"
"2434",140,"wise men bowing down before him. It had cost fifty cents; but Elzbieta"
"2435",140,"had a feeling that money spent for such things was not to be counted too"
"2436",140,"closely, it would come back in hidden ways. The piece was beautiful on"
"2437",140,"the parlor mantel, and one could not have a home without some sort of"
"2438",140,"ornament."
"2439",140,""
"2440",140,"The cost of the wedding feast would, of course, be returned to them;"
"2441",140,"but the problem was to raise it even temporarily. They had been in the"
"2442",140,"neighborhood so short a time that they could not get much credit, and"
"2443",140,"there was no one except Szedvilas from whom they could borrow even a"
"2444",140,"little. Evening after evening Jurgis and Ona would sit and figure the"
"2445",140,"expenses, calculating the term of their separation. They could not"
"2446",140,"possibly manage it decently for less than two hundred dollars, and even"
"2447",140,"though they were welcome to count in the whole of the earnings of Marija"
"2448",140,"and Jonas, as a loan, they could not hope to raise this sum in less"
"2449",140,"than four or five months. So Ona began thinking of seeking employment"
"2450",140,"herself, saying that if she had even ordinarily good luck, she might be"
"2451",140,"able to take two months off the time. They were just beginning to adjust"
"2452",140,"themselves to this necessity, when out of the clear sky there fell a"
"2453",140,"thunderbolt upon them--a calamity that scattered all their hopes to the"
"2454",140,"four winds."
"2455",140,""
"2456",140,"About a block away from them there lived another Lithuanian family,"
"2457",140,"consisting of an elderly widow and one grown son; their name was"
"2458",140,"Majauszkis, and our friends struck up an acquaintance with them before"
"2459",140,"long. One evening they came over for a visit, and naturally the first"
"2460",140,"subject upon which the conversation turned was the neighborhood and its"
"2461",140,"history; and then Grandmother Majauszkiene, as the old lady was called,"
"2462",140,"proceeded to recite to them a string of horrors that fairly froze their"
"2463",140,"blood. She was a wrinkled-up and wizened personage--she must have been"
"2464",140,"eighty--and as she mumbled the grim story through her toothless gums,"
"2465",140,"she seemed a very old witch to them. Grandmother Majauszkiene had lived"
"2466",140,"in the midst of misfortune so long that it had come to be her element,"
"2467",140,"and she talked about starvation, sickness, and death as other people"
"2468",140,"might about weddings and holidays."
"2469",140,""
"2470",140,"The thing came gradually. In the first place as to the house they"
"2471",140,"had bought, it was not new at all, as they had supposed; it was about"
"2472",140,"fifteen years old, and there was nothing new upon it but the paint,"
"2473",140,"which was so bad that it needed to be put on new every year or two. The"
"2474",140,"house was one of a whole row that was built by a company which existed"
"2475",140,"to make money by swindling poor people. The family had paid fifteen"
"2476",140,"hundred dollars for it, and it had not cost the builders five hundred,"
"2477",140,"when it was new. Grandmother Majauszkiene knew that because her son"
"2478",140,"belonged to a political organization with a contractor who put up"
"2479",140,"exactly such houses. They used the very flimsiest and cheapest material;"
"2480",140,"they built the houses a dozen at a time, and they cared about nothing at"
"2481",140,"all except the outside shine. The family could take her word as to the"
"2482",140,"trouble they would have, for she had been through it all--she and her"
"2483",140,"son had bought their house in exactly the same way. They had fooled the"
"2484",140,"company, however, for her son was a skilled man, who made as high as a"
"2485",140,"hundred dollars a month, and as he had had sense enough not to marry,"
"2486",140,"they had been able to pay for the house."
"2487",140,""
"2488",140,"Grandmother Majauszkiene saw that her friends were puzzled at this"
"2489",140,"remark; they did not quite see how paying for the house was ""fooling the"
"2490",140,"company."" Evidently they were very inexperienced. Cheap as the houses"
"2491",140,"were, they were sold with the idea that the people who bought them would"
"2492",140,"not be able to pay for them. When they failed--if it were only by a"
"2493",140,"single month--they would lose the house and all that they had paid on"
"2494",140,"it, and then the company would sell it over again. And did they often"
"2495",140,"get a chance to do that? Dieve! (Grandmother Majauszkiene raised her"
"2496",140,"hands.) They did it--how often no one could say, but certainly more than"
"2497",140,"half of the time. They might ask any one who knew anything at all about"
"2498",140,"Packingtown as to that; she had been living here ever since this house"
"2499",140,"was built, and she could tell them all about it. And had it ever been"
"2500",140,"sold before? Susimilkie! Why, since it had been built, no less than four"
"2501",140,"families that their informant could name had tried to buy it and failed."
"2502",140,"She would tell them a little about it."
"2503",140,""
"2504",140,"The first family had been Germans. The families had all been of"
"2505",140,"different nationalities--there had been a representative of several"
"2506",140,"races that had displaced each other in the stockyards. Grandmother"
"2507",140,"Majauszkiene had come to America with her son at a time when so far as"
"2508",140,"she knew there was only one other Lithuanian family in the district;"
"2509",140,"the workers had all been Germans then--skilled cattle butchers that the"
"2510",140,"packers had brought from abroad to start the business. Afterward, as"
"2511",140,"cheaper labor had come, these Germans had moved away. The next were the"
"2512",140,"Irish--there had been six or eight years when Packingtown had been a"
"2513",140,"regular Irish city. There were a few colonies of them still here, enough"
"2514",140,"to run all the unions and the police force and get all the graft; but"
"2515",140,"most of those who were working in the packing houses had gone away at"
"2516",140,"the next drop in wages--after the big strike. The Bohemians had come"
"2517",140,"then, and after them the Poles. People said that old man Durham himself"
"2518",140,"was responsible for these immigrations; he had sworn that he would fix"
"2519",140,"the people of Packingtown so that they would never again call a strike"
"2520",140,"on him, and so he had sent his agents into every city and village in"
"2521",140,"Europe to spread the tale of the chances of work and high wages at the"
"2522",140,"stockyards. The people had come in hordes; and old Durham had squeezed"
"2523",140,"them tighter and tighter, speeding them up and grinding them to pieces"
"2524",140,"and sending for new ones. The Poles, who had come by tens of thousands,"
"2525",140,"had been driven to the wall by the Lithuanians, and now the Lithuanians"
"2526",140,"were giving way to the Slovaks. Who there was poorer and more miserable"
"2527",140,"than the Slovaks, Grandmother Majauszkiene had no idea, but the packers"
"2528",140,"would find them, never fear. It was easy to bring them, for wages were"
"2529",140,"really much higher, and it was only when it was too late that the poor"
"2530",140,"people found out that everything else was higher too. They were like"
"2531",140,"rats in a trap, that was the truth; and more of them were piling in"
"2532",140,"every day. By and by they would have their revenge, though, for the"
"2533",140,"thing was getting beyond human endurance, and the people would rise and"
"2534",140,"murder the packers. Grandmother Majauszkiene was a socialist, or some"
"2535",140,"such strange thing; another son of hers was working in the mines of"
"2536",140,"Siberia, and the old lady herself had made speeches in her time--which"
"2537",140,"made her seem all the more terrible to her present auditors."
"2538",140,""
"2539",140,"They called her back to the story of the house. The German family had"
"2540",140,"been a good sort. To be sure there had been a great many of them, which"
"2541",140,"was a common failing in Packingtown; but they had worked hard, and the"
"2542",140,"father had been a steady man, and they had a good deal more than half"
"2543",140,"paid for the house. But he had been killed in an elevator accident in"
"2544",140,"Durham's."
"2545",140,""
"2546",140,"Then there had come the Irish, and there had been lots of them, too;"
"2547",140,"the husband drank and beat the children--the neighbors could hear them"
"2548",140,"shrieking any night. They were behind with their rent all the time,"
"2549",140,"but the company was good to them; there was some politics back of that,"
"2550",140,"Grandmother Majauszkiene could not say just what, but the Laffertys had"
"2551",140,"belonged to the ""War Whoop League,"" which was a sort of political club"
"2552",140,"of all the thugs and rowdies in the district; and if you belonged to"
"2553",140,"that, you could never be arrested for anything. Once upon a time old"
"2554",140,"Lafferty had been caught with a gang that had stolen cows from several"
"2555",140,"of the poor people of the neighborhood and butchered them in an old"
"2556",140,"shanty back of the yards and sold them. He had been in jail only three"
"2557",140,"days for it, and had come out laughing, and had not even lost his place"
"2558",140,"in the packing house. He had gone all to ruin with the drink, however,"
"2559",140,"and lost his power; one of his sons, who was a good man, had kept him"
"2560",140,"and the family up for a year or two, but then he had got sick with"
"2561",140,"consumption."
"2562",140,""
"2563",140,"That was another thing, Grandmother Majauszkiene interrupted"
"2564",140,"herself--this house was unlucky. Every family that lived in it, some one"
"2565",140,"was sure to get consumption. Nobody could tell why that was; there must"
"2566",140,"be something about the house, or the way it was built--some folks said"
"2567",140,"it was because the building had been begun in the dark of the moon."
"2568",140,"There were dozens of houses that way in Packingtown. Sometimes there"
"2569",140,"would be a particular room that you could point out--if anybody slept in"
"2570",140,"that room he was just as good as dead. With this house it had been the"
"2571",140,"Irish first; and then a Bohemian family had lost a child of it--though,"
"2572",140,"to be sure, that was uncertain, since it was hard to tell what was the"
"2573",140,"matter with children who worked in the yards. In those days there had"
"2574",140,"been no law about the age of children--the packers had worked all but"
"2575",140,"the babies. At this remark the family looked puzzled, and Grandmother"
"2576",140,"Majauszkiene again had to make an explanation--that it was against the"
"2577",140,"law for children to work before they were sixteen. What was the sense of"
"2578",140,"that? they asked. They had been thinking of letting little Stanislovas"
"2579",140,"go to work. Well, there was no need to worry, Grandmother Majauszkiene"
"2580",140,"said--the law made no difference except that it forced people to lie"
"2581",140,"about the ages of their children. One would like to know what the"
"2582",140,"lawmakers expected them to do; there were families that had no possible"
"2583",140,"means of support except the children, and the law provided them no"
"2584",140,"other way of getting a living. Very often a man could get no work in"
"2585",140,"Packingtown for months, while a child could go and get a place easily;"
"2586",140,"there was always some new machine, by which the packers could get as"
"2587",140,"much work out of a child as they had been able to get out of a man, and"
"2588",140,"for a third of the pay."
"2589",140,""
"2590",140,"To come back to the house again, it was the woman of the next family"
"2591",140,"that had died. That was after they had been there nearly four years, and"
"2592",140,"this woman had had twins regularly every year--and there had been more"
"2593",140,"than you could count when they moved in. After she died the man would"
"2594",140,"go to work all day and leave them to shift for themselves--the neighbors"
"2595",140,"would help them now and then, for they would almost freeze to death. At"
"2596",140,"the end there were three days that they were alone, before it was found"
"2597",140,"out that the father was dead. He was a ""floorsman"" at Jones's, and a"
"2598",140,"wounded steer had broken loose and mashed him against a pillar. Then the"
"2599",140,"children had been taken away, and the company had sold the house that"
"2600",140,"very same week to a party of emigrants."
"2601",140,""
"2602",140,"So this grim old women went on with her tale of horrors. How much of it"
"2603",140,"was exaggeration--who could tell? It was only too plausible. There"
"2604",140,"was that about consumption, for instance. They knew nothing about"
"2605",140,"consumption whatever, except that it made people cough; and for two"
"2606",140,"weeks they had been worrying about a coughing-spell of Antanas. It"
"2607",140,"seemed to shake him all over, and it never stopped; you could see a red"
"2608",140,"stain wherever he had spit upon the floor."
"2609",140,""
"2610",140,"And yet all these things were as nothing to what came a little later."
"2611",140,"They had begun to question the old lady as to why one family had been"
"2612",140,"unable to pay, trying to show her by figures that it ought to have been"
"2613",140,"possible; and Grandmother Majauszkiene had disputed their figures--""You"
"2614",140,"say twelve dollars a month; but that does not include the interest."""
"2615",140,""
"2616",140,"Then they stared at her. ""Interest!"" they cried."
"2617",140,""
"2618",140,"""Interest on the money you still owe,"" she answered."
"2619",140,""
"2620",140,"""But we don't have to pay any interest!"" they exclaimed, three or four"
"2621",140,"at once. ""We only have to pay twelve dollars each month."""
"2622",140,""
"2623",140,"And for this she laughed at them. ""You are like all the rest,"" she said;"
"2624",140,"""they trick you and eat you alive. They never sell the houses without"
"2625",140,"interest. Get your deed, and see."""
"2626",140,""
"2627",140,"Then, with a horrible sinking of the heart, Teta Elzbieta unlocked her"
"2628",140,"bureau and brought out the paper that had already caused them so many"
"2629",140,"agonies. Now they sat round, scarcely breathing, while the old lady, who"
"2630",140,"could read English, ran over it. ""Yes,"" she said, finally, ""here it is,"
"2631",140,"of course: 'With interest thereon monthly, at the rate of seven per cent"
"2632",140,"per annum.'"""
"2633",140,""
"2634",140,"And there followed a dead silence. ""What does that mean?"" asked Jurgis"
"2635",140,"finally, almost in a whisper."
"2636",140,""
"2637",140,"""That means,"" replied the other, ""that you have to pay them seven"
"2638",140,"dollars next month, as well as the twelve dollars."""
"2639",140,""
"2640",140,"Then again there was not a sound. It was sickening, like a nightmare,"
"2641",140,"in which suddenly something gives way beneath you, and you feel yourself"
"2642",140,"sinking, sinking, down into bottomless abysses. As if in a flash of"
"2643",140,"lightning they saw themselves--victims of a relentless fate, cornered,"
"2644",140,"trapped, in the grip of destruction. All the fair structure of their"
"2645",140,"hopes came crashing about their ears.--And all the time the old woman"
"2646",140,"was going on talking. They wished that she would be still; her voice"
"2647",140,"sounded like the croaking of some dismal raven. Jurgis sat with his"
"2648",140,"hands clenched and beads of perspiration on his forehead, and there was"
"2649",140,"a great lump in Ona's throat, choking her. Then suddenly Teta Elzbieta"
"2650",140,"broke the silence with a wail, and Marija began to wring her hands and"
"2651",140,"sob, ""Ai! Ai! Beda man!"""
"2652",140,""
"2653",140,"All their outcry did them no good, of course. There sat Grandmother"
"2654",140,"Majauszkiene, unrelenting, typifying fate. No, of course it was not"
"2655",140,"fair, but then fairness had nothing to do with it. And of course they"
"2656",140,"had not known it. They had not been intended to know it. But it was in"
"2657",140,"the deed, and that was all that was necessary, as they would find when"
"2658",140,"the time came."
"2659",140,""
"2660",140,"Somehow or other they got rid of their guest, and then they passed a"
"2661",140,"night of lamentation. The children woke up and found out that something"
"2662",140,"was wrong, and they wailed and would not be comforted. In the morning,"
"2663",140,"of course, most of them had to go to work, the packing houses would not"
"2664",140,"stop for their sorrows; but by seven o'clock Ona and her stepmother were"
"2665",140,"standing at the door of the office of the agent. Yes, he told them, when"
"2666",140,"he came, it was quite true that they would have to pay interest. And"
"2667",140,"then Teta Elzbieta broke forth into protestations and reproaches, so"
"2668",140,"that the people outside stopped and peered in at the window. The agent"
"2669",140,"was as bland as ever. He was deeply pained, he said. He had not told"
"2670",140,"them, simply because he had supposed they would understand that they had"
"2671",140,"to pay interest upon their debt, as a matter of course."
"2672",140,""
"2673",140,"So they came away, and Ona went down to the yards, and at noontime saw"
"2674",140,"Jurgis and told him. Jurgis took it stolidly--he had made up his mind to"
"2675",140,"it by this time. It was part of fate; they would manage it somehow--he"
"2676",140,"made his usual answer, ""I will work harder."" It would upset their plans"
"2677",140,"for a time; and it would perhaps be necessary for Ona to get work"
"2678",140,"after all. Then Ona added that Teta Elzbieta had decided that little"
"2679",140,"Stanislovas would have to work too. It was not fair to let Jurgis and"
"2680",140,"her support the family--the family would have to help as it could."
"2681",140,"Previously Jurgis had scouted this idea, but now knit his brows and"
"2682",140,"nodded his head slowly--yes, perhaps it would be best; they would all"
"2683",140,"have to make some sacrifices now."
"2684",140,""
"2685",140,"So Ona set out that day to hunt for work; and at night Marija came home"
"2686",140,"saying that she had met a girl named Jasaityte who had a friend that"
"2687",140,"worked in one of the wrapping rooms in Brown's, and might get a place"
"2688",140,"for Ona there; only the forelady was the kind that takes presents--it"
"2689",140,"was no use for any one to ask her for a place unless at the same time"
"2690",140,"they slipped a ten-dollar bill into her hand. Jurgis was not in the"
"2691",140,"least surprised at this now--he merely asked what the wages of the place"
"2692",140,"would be. So negotiations were opened, and after an interview Ona came"
"2693",140,"home and reported that the forelady seemed to like her, and had said"
"2694",140,"that, while she was not sure, she thought she might be able to put her"
"2695",140,"at work sewing covers on hams, a job at which she would earn as much as"
"2696",140,"eight or ten dollars a week. That was a bid, so Marija reported, after"
"2697",140,"consulting her friend; and then there was an anxious conference at home."
"2698",140,"The work was done in one of the cellars, and Jurgis did not want Ona to"
"2699",140,"work in such a place; but then it was easy work, and one could not have"
"2700",140,"everything. So in the end Ona, with a ten-dollar bill burning a hole in"
"2701",140,"her palm, had another interview with the forelady."
"2702",140,""
"2703",140,"Meantime Teta Elzbieta had taken Stanislovas to the priest and gotten a"
"2704",140,"certificate to the effect that he was two years older than he was; and"
"2705",140,"with it the little boy now sallied forth to make his fortune in the"
"2706",140,"world. It chanced that Durham had just put in a wonderful new lard"
"2707",140,"machine, and when the special policeman in front of the time station"
"2708",140,"saw Stanislovas and his document, he smiled to himself and told him to"
"2709",140,"go--""Czia! Czia!"" pointing. And so Stanislovas went down a long stone"
"2710",140,"corridor, and up a flight of stairs, which took him into a room lighted"
"2711",140,"by electricity, with the new machines for filling lard cans at work"
"2712",140,"in it. The lard was finished on the floor above, and it came in little"
"2713",140,"jets, like beautiful, wriggling, snow-white snakes of unpleasant odor."
"2714",140,"There were several kinds and sizes of jets, and after a certain precise"
"2715",140,"quantity had come out, each stopped automatically, and the wonderful"
"2716",140,"machine made a turn, and took the can under another jet, and so on,"
"2717",140,"until it was filled neatly to the brim, and pressed tightly, and"
"2718",140,"smoothed off. To attend to all this and fill several hundred cans of"
"2719",140,"lard per hour, there were necessary two human creatures, one of whom"
"2720",140,"knew how to place an empty lard can on a certain spot every few seconds,"
"2721",140,"and the other of whom knew how to take a full lard can off a certain"
"2722",140,"spot every few seconds and set it upon a tray."
"2723",140,""
"2724",140,"And so, after little Stanislovas had stood gazing timidly about him for"
"2725",140,"a few minutes, a man approached him, and asked what he wanted, to which"
"2726",140,"Stanislovas said, ""Job."" Then the man said ""How old?"" and Stanislovas"
"2727",140,"answered, ""Sixtin."" Once or twice every year a state inspector would"
"2728",140,"come wandering through the packing plants, asking a child here and there"
"2729",140,"how old he was; and so the packers were very careful to comply with the"
"2730",140,"law, which cost them as much trouble as was now involved in the boss's"
"2731",140,"taking the document from the little boy, and glancing at it, and then"
"2732",140,"sending it to the office to be filed away. Then he set some one else at"
"2733",140,"a different job, and showed the lad how to place a lard can every time"
"2734",140,"the empty arm of the remorseless machine came to him; and so was decided"
"2735",140,"the place in the universe of little Stanislovas, and his destiny till"
"2736",140,"the end of his days. Hour after hour, day after day, year after year, it"
"2737",140,"was fated that he should stand upon a certain square foot of floor from"
"2738",140,"seven in the morning until noon, and again from half-past twelve till"

"2743",140,"dark as night when he went in to work, and dark as night again when"
"2744",140,"he came out, and so he would never know what the sun looked like on"

"2793",140,"It was fully a week before they were all normal again, and meantime,"
"2794",140,"with whining children and cross adults, the house was not a pleasant"

"2796",140,"things considered. It was because of Ona; the least glance at her was"
"2797",140,"always enough to make him control himself. She was so sensitive--she was"
"2798",140,"not fitted for such a life as this; and a hundred times a day, when he"
"2799",140,"thought of her, he would clench his hands and fling himself again at the"
"2800",140,"task before him. She was too good for him, he told himself, and he was"
"2801",140,"afraid, because she was his. So long he had hungered to possess her,"
"2802",140,"but now that the time had come he knew that he had not earned the right;"
"2803",140,"that she trusted him so was all her own simple goodness, and no virtue"
"2804",140,"of his. But he was resolved that she should never find this out, and so"
"2805",140,"was always on the watch to see that he did not betray any of his ugly"
"2806",140,"self; he would take care even in little matters, such as his manners,"

"2816",140,"from the world. He had learned the ways of things about him now. It was"
"2817",140,"a war of each against all, and the devil take the hindmost. You did not"

"2819",140,"you. You went about with your soul full of suspicion and hatred; you"
"2820",140,"understood that you were environed by hostile powers that were trying to"
"2821",140,"get your money, and who used all the virtues to bait their traps with."
"2822",140,"The store-keepers plastered up their windows with all sorts of lies to"

"2828",140,"So Jurgis said that he understood it; and yet it was really pitiful, for"

"2830",140,"for instance, vowing upon his knees that he would save Ona from harm,"
"2831",140,"and only a week later she was suffering atrociously, and from the blow"
"2832",140,"of an enemy that he could not possibly have thwarted. There came a day"
"2833",140,"when the rain fell in torrents; and it being December, to be wet with it"
"2834",140,"and have to sit all day long in one of the cold cellars of Brown's was"
"2835",140,"no laughing matter. Ona was a working girl, and did not own waterproofs"
"2836",140,"and such things, and so Jurgis took her and put her on the streetcar."
"2837",140,"Now it chanced that this car line was owned by gentlemen who were trying"
"2838",140,"to make money. And the city having passed an ordinance requiring them to"
"2839",140,"give transfers, they had fallen into a rage; and first they had made a"
"2840",140,"rule that transfers could be had only when the fare was paid; and later,"
"2841",140,"growing still uglier, they had made another--that the passenger must ask"
"2842",140,"for the transfer, the conductor was not allowed to offer it. Now Ona"
"2843",140,"had been told that she was to get a transfer; but it was not her way to"
"2844",140,"speak up, and so she merely waited, following the conductor about with"
"2845",140,"her eyes, wondering when he would think of her. When at last the time"
"2846",140,"came for her to get out, she asked for the transfer, and was refused."
"2847",140,"Not knowing what to make of this, she began to argue with the conductor,"
"2848",140,"in a language of which he did not understand a word. After warning her"
"2849",140,"several times, he pulled the bell and the car went on--at which Ona"
"2850",140,"burst into tears. At the next corner she got out, of course; and as she"
"2851",140,"had no more money, she had to walk the rest of the way to the yards in"
"2852",140,"the pouring rain. And so all day long she sat shivering, and came home"
"2853",140,"at night with her teeth chattering and pains in her head and back. For"
"2854",140,"two weeks afterward she suffered cruelly--and yet every day she had to"
"2855",140,"drag herself to her work. The forewoman was especially severe with Ona,"
"2856",140,"because she believed that she was obstinate on account of having been"
"2857",140,"refused a holiday the day after her wedding. Ona had an idea that her"
"2858",140,"""forelady"" did not like to have her girls marry--perhaps because she was"
"2859",140,"old and ugly and unmarried herself."
"2860",140,""
"2861",140,"There were many such dangers, in which the odds were all against them."
"2862",140,"Their children were not as well as they had been at home; but how could"
"2863",140,"they know that there was no sewer to their house, and that the drainage"
"2864",140,"of fifteen years was in a cesspool under it? How could they know that"
"2865",140,"the pale-blue milk that they bought around the corner was watered, and"
"2866",140,"doctored with formaldehyde besides? When the children were not well"
"2867",140,"at home, Teta Elzbieta would gather herbs and cure them; now she was"
"2868",140,"obliged to go to the drugstore and buy extracts--and how was she to know"
"2869",140,"that they were all adulterated? How could they find out that their tea"
"2870",140,"and coffee, their sugar and flour, had been doctored; that their canned"
"2871",140,"peas had been colored with copper salts, and their fruit jams with"
"2872",140,"aniline dyes? And even if they had known it, what good would it have"
"2873",140,"done them, since there was no place within miles of them where any other"
"2874",140,"sort was to be had? The bitter winter was coming, and they had to save"
"2875",140,"money to get more clothing and bedding; but it would not matter in the"
"2876",140,"least how much they saved, they could not get anything to keep them"
"2877",140,"warm. All the clothing that was to be had in the stores was made of"
"2878",140,"cotton and shoddy, which is made by tearing old clothes to pieces and"
"2879",140,"weaving the fiber again. If they paid higher prices, they might get"
"2880",140,"frills and fanciness, or be cheated; but genuine quality they could not"
"2881",140,"obtain for love nor money. A young friend of Szedvilas', recently come"
"2882",140,"from abroad, had become a clerk in a store on Ashland Avenue, and he"
"2883",140,"narrated with glee a trick that had been played upon an unsuspecting"
"2884",140,"countryman by his boss. The customer had desired to purchase an alarm"
"2885",140,"clock, and the boss had shown him two exactly similar, telling him that"
"2886",140,"the price of one was a dollar and of the other a dollar seventy-five."
"2887",140,"Upon being asked what the difference was, the man had wound up the first"
"2888",140,"halfway and the second all the way, and showed the customer how the"
"2889",140,"latter made twice as much noise; upon which the customer remarked that"
"2890",140,"he was a sound sleeper, and had better take the more expensive clock!"

"2899",140,"yet so sordid and petty, so ugly, so humiliating--unredeemed by the"
"2900",140,"slightest touch of dignity or even of pathos. It is a kind of anguish"

"2902",140,"into the vocabulary of poets--the details of it cannot be told in"

"2907",140,"in efforts to get rid of them? After long hesitation and uncertainty"
"2908",140,"they paid twenty-five cents for a big package of insect powder--a patent"
"2909",140,"preparation which chanced to be ninety-five per cent gypsum, a harmless"

"2911",140,"the least effect, except upon a few roaches which had the misfortune to"
"2912",140,"drink water after eating it, and so got their inwards set in a coating"
"2913",140,"of plaster of Paris. The family, having no idea of this, and no more"

"2917",140,"Then there was old Antanas. The winter came, and the place where he"
"2918",140,"worked was a dark, unheated cellar, where you could see your breath all"
"2919",140,"day, and where your fingers sometimes tried to freeze. So the old man's"
"2920",140,"cough grew every day worse, until there came a time when it hardly ever"
"2921",140,"stopped, and he had become a nuisance about the place. Then, too, a"
"2922",140,"still more dreadful thing happened to him; he worked in a place where"
"2923",140,"his feet were soaked in chemicals, and it was not long before they had"
"2924",140,"eaten through his new boots. Then sores began to break out on his feet,"
"2925",140,"and grow worse and worse. Whether it was that his blood was bad, or"
"2926",140,"there had been a cut, he could not say; but he asked the men about it,"
"2927",140,"and learned that it was a regular thing--it was the saltpeter. Every one"
"2928",140,"felt it, sooner or later, and then it was all up with him, at least for"
"2929",140,"that sort of work. The sores would never heal--in the end his toes would"
"2930",140,"drop off, if he did not quit. Yet old Antanas would not quit; he saw the"
"2931",140,"suffering of his family, and he remembered what it had cost him to get"
"2932",140,"a job. So he tied up his feet, and went on limping about and coughing,"
"2933",140,"until at last he fell to pieces, all at once and in a heap, like the"
"2934",140,"One-Horse Shay. They carried him to a dry place and laid him on the"
"2935",140,"floor, and that night two of the men helped him home. The poor old man"
"2936",140,"was put to bed, and though he tried it every morning until the end, he"
"2937",140,"never could get up again. He would lie there and cough and cough, day"
"2938",140,"and night, wasting away to a mere skeleton. There came a time when there"
"2939",140,"was so little flesh on him that the bones began to poke through--which"
"2940",140,"was a horrible thing to see or even to think of. And one night he had"
"2941",140,"a choking fit, and a little river of blood came out of his mouth. The"
"2942",140,"family, wild with terror, sent for a doctor, and paid half a dollar to"
"2943",140,"be told that there was nothing to be done. Mercifully the doctor did not"
"2944",140,"say this so that the old man could hear, for he was still clinging to"
"2945",140,"the faith that tomorrow or next day he would be better, and could go"
"2946",140,"back to his job. The company had sent word to him that they would keep"
"2947",140,"it for him--or rather Jurgis had bribed one of the men to come one"
"2948",140,"Sunday afternoon and say they had. Dede Antanas continued to believe"
"2949",140,"it, while three more hemorrhages came; and then at last one morning they"
"2950",140,"found him stiff and cold. Things were not going well with them then,"
"2951",140,"and though it nearly broke Teta Elzbieta's heart, they were forced to"
"2952",140,"dispense with nearly all the decencies of a funeral; they had only a"
"2953",140,"hearse, and one hack for the women and children; and Jurgis, who was"
"2954",140,"learning things fast, spent all Sunday making a bargain for these, and"
"2955",140,"he made it in the presence of witnesses, so that when the man tried to"
"2956",140,"charge him for all sorts of incidentals, he did not have to pay. For"
"2957",140,"twenty-five years old Antanas Rudkus and his son had dwelt in the forest"
"2958",140,"together, and it was hard to part in this way; perhaps it was just as"
"2959",140,"well that Jurgis had to give all his attention to the task of having"
"2960",140,"a funeral without being bankrupted, and so had no time to indulge in"
"2961",140,"memories and grief."

"2967",140,"and hail, and strew the ground with these weaker branches. Just so it"
"2968",140,"was in Packingtown; the whole district braced itself for the struggle"

"2970",140,"All the year round they had been serving as cogs in the great packing"
"2971",140,"machine; and now was the time for the renovating of it, and the"
"2972",140,"replacing of damaged parts. There came pneumonia and grippe, stalking"
"2973",140,"among them, seeking for weakened constitutions; there was the annual"
"2974",140,"harvest of those whom tuberculosis had been dragging down. There came"
"2975",140,"cruel, cold, and biting winds, and blizzards of snow, all testing"
"2976",140,"relentlessly for failing muscles and impoverished blood. Sooner or later"
"2977",140,"came the day when the unfit one did not report for work; and then, with"
"2978",140,"no time lost in waiting, and no inquiries or regrets, there was a chance"
"2979",140,"for a new hand."
"2980",140,""
"2981",140,"The new hands were here by the thousands. All day long the gates of the"
"2982",140,"packing houses were besieged by starving and penniless men; they came,"
"2983",140,"literally, by the thousands every single morning, fighting with each"
"2984",140,"other for a chance for life. Blizzards and cold made no difference to"
"2985",140,"them, they were always on hand; they were on hand two hours before the"
"2986",140,"sun rose, an hour before the work began. Sometimes their faces"
"2987",140,"froze, sometimes their feet and their hands; sometimes they froze all"
"2988",140,"together--but still they came, for they had no other place to go. One"
"2989",140,"day Durham advertised in the paper for two hundred men to cut ice; and"

"2992",140,"forty score of them crowded into the station house of the stockyards"
"2993",140,"district--they filled the rooms, sleeping in each other's laps, toboggan"
"2994",140,"fashion, and they piled on top of each other in the corridors, till the"
"2995",140,"police shut the doors and left some to freeze outside. On the morrow,"
"2996",140,"before daybreak, there were three thousand at Durham's, and the police"
"2997",140,"reserves had to be sent for to quell the riot. Then Durham's bosses"
"2998",140,"picked out twenty of the biggest; the ""two hundred"" proved to have been"

"3001",140,"Four or five miles to the eastward lay the lake, and over this the"
"3002",140,"bitter winds came raging. Sometimes the thermometer would fall to ten or"
"3003",140,"twenty degrees below zero at night, and in the morning the streets would"
"3004",140,"be piled with snowdrifts up to the first-floor windows. The streets"
"3005",140,"through which our friends had to go to their work were all unpaved and"
"3006",140,"full of deep holes and gullies; in summer, when it rained hard, a man"

"3013",140,"And if it was bad for the men, one may imagine how the women and"

"3040",140,"risk of all, because whenever they had to pass to another room they had"
"3041",140,"to go through ice-cold corridors, and sometimes with nothing on above"
"3042",140,"the waist except a sleeveless undershirt. On the killing beds you were"
"3043",140,"apt to be covered with blood, and it would freeze solid; if you leaned"
"3044",140,"against a pillar, you would freeze to that, and if you put your hand"
"3045",140,"upon the blade of your knife, you would run a chance of leaving your"
"3046",140,"skin on it. The men would tie up their feet in newspapers and old sacks,"
"3047",140,"and these would be soaked in blood and frozen, and then soaked again,"
"3048",140,"and so on, until by nighttime a man would be walking on great lumps the"
"3049",140,"size of the feet of an elephant. Now and then, when the bosses were"
"3050",140,"not looking, you would see them plunging their feet and ankles into the"
"3051",140,"steaming hot carcass of the steer, or darting across the room to"
"3052",140,"the hot-water jets. The cruelest thing of all was that nearly all of"
"3053",140,"them--all of those who used knives--were unable to wear gloves, and"
"3054",140,"their arms would be white with frost and their hands would grow numb,"
"3055",140,"and then of course there would be accidents. Also the air would be full"
"3056",140,"of steam, from the hot water and the hot blood, so that you could not"
"3057",140,"see five feet before you; and then, with men rushing about at the speed"
"3058",140,"they kept up on the killing beds, and all with butcher knives, like"
"3059",140,"razors, in their hands--well, it was to be counted as a wonder that"
"3060",140,"there were not more men slaughtered than cattle."
"3061",140,""
"3062",140,"And yet all this inconvenience they might have put up with, if only it"
"3063",140,"had not been for one thing--if only there had been some place where they"
"3064",140,"might eat. Jurgis had either to eat his dinner amid the stench in which"
"3065",140,"he had worked, or else to rush, as did all his companions, to any one of"
"3066",140,"the hundreds of liquor stores which stretched out their arms to him. To"
"3067",140,"the west of the yards ran Ashland Avenue, and here was an unbroken"
"3068",140,"line of saloons--""Whiskey Row,"" they called it; to the north was"
"3069",140,"Forty-seventh Street, where there were half a dozen to the block, and at"
"3070",140,"the angle of the two was ""Whiskey Point,"" a space of fifteen or twenty"
"3071",140,"acres, and containing one glue factory and about two hundred saloons."
"3072",140,""
"3073",140,"One might walk among these and take his choice: ""Hot pea-soup and boiled"
"3074",140,"cabbage today."" ""Sauerkraut and hot frankfurters. Walk in."" ""Bean soup"
"3075",140,"and stewed lamb. Welcome."" All of these things were printed in many"
"3076",140,"languages, as were also the names of the resorts, which were infinite"
"3077",140,"in their variety and appeal. There was the ""Home Circle"" and the"
"3078",140,"""Cosey Corner""; there were ""Firesides"" and ""Hearthstones"" and ""Pleasure"
"3079",140,"Palaces"" and ""Wonderlands"" and ""Dream Castles"" and ""Love's Delights."""
"3080",140,"Whatever else they were called, they were sure to be called ""Union"
"3081",140,"Headquarters,"" and to hold out a welcome to workingmen; and there was"
"3082",140,"always a warm stove, and a chair near it, and some friends to laugh and"
"3083",140,"talk with. There was only one condition attached,--you must drink. If"
"3084",140,"you went in not intending to drink, you would be put out in no time, and"
"3085",140,"if you were slow about going, like as not you would get your head split"
"3086",140,"open with a beer bottle in the bargain. But all of the men understood"
"3087",140,"the convention and drank; they believed that by it they were getting"
"3088",140,"something for nothing--for they did not need to take more than one"
"3089",140,"drink, and upon the strength of it they might fill themselves up with a"
"3090",140,"good hot dinner. This did not always work out in practice, however, for"
"3091",140,"there was pretty sure to be a friend who would treat you, and then you"
"3092",140,"would have to treat him. Then some one else would come in--and, anyhow,"
"3093",140,"a few drinks were good for a man who worked hard. As he went back he did"
"3094",140,"not shiver so, he had more courage for his task; the deadly brutalizing"
"3095",140,"monotony of it did not afflict him so,--he had ideas while he worked,"
"3096",140,"and took a more cheerful view of his circumstances. On the way home,"
"3097",140,"however, the shivering was apt to come on him again; and so he would"
"3098",140,"have to stop once or twice to warm up against the cruel cold. As there"
"3099",140,"were hot things to eat in this saloon too, he might get home late to his"
"3100",140,"supper, or he might not get home at all. And then his wife might set out"
"3101",140,"to look for him, and she too would feel the cold; and perhaps she would"
"3102",140,"have some of the children with her--and so a whole family would drift"
"3103",140,"into drinking, as the current of a river drifts downstream. As if to"
"3104",140,"complete the chain, the packers all paid their men in checks, refusing"
"3105",140,"all requests to pay in coin; and where in Packingtown could a man go to"
"3106",140,"have his check cashed but to a saloon, where he could pay for the favor"
"3107",140,"by spending a part of the money?"
"3108",140,""
"3109",140,"From all of these things Jurgis was saved because of Ona. He never would"
"3110",140,"take but the one drink at noontime; and so he got the reputation of"
"3111",140,"being a surly fellow, and was not quite welcome at the saloons, and had"
"3112",140,"to drift about from one to another. Then at night he would go straight"
"3113",140,"home, helping Ona and Stanislovas, or often putting the former on a car."
"3114",140,"And when he got home perhaps he would have to trudge several blocks, and"
"3115",140,"come staggering back through the snowdrifts with a bag of coal upon"
"3116",140,"his shoulder. Home was not a very attractive place--at least not this"
"3117",140,"winter. They had only been able to buy one stove, and this was a small"
"3118",140,"one, and proved not big enough to warm even the kitchen in the bitterest"
"3119",140,"weather. This made it hard for Teta Elzbieta all day, and for the"
"3120",140,"children when they could not get to school. At night they would sit"
"3121",140,"huddled round this stove, while they ate their supper off their laps;"
"3122",140,"and then Jurgis and Jonas would smoke a pipe, after which they would all"
"3123",140,"crawl into their beds to get warm, after putting out the fire to save"
"3124",140,"the coal. Then they would have some frightful experiences with the cold."
"3125",140,"They would sleep with all their clothes on, including their overcoats,"
"3126",140,"and put over them all the bedding and spare clothing they owned; the"
"3127",140,"children would sleep all crowded into one bed, and yet even so they"
"3128",140,"could not keep warm. The outside ones would be shivering and sobbing,"
"3129",140,"crawling over the others and trying to get down into the center, and"
"3130",140,"causing a fight. This old house with the leaky weatherboards was a"
"3131",140,"very different thing from their cabins at home, with great thick walls"
"3132",140,"plastered inside and outside with mud; and the cold which came upon them"
"3133",140,"was a living thing, a demon-presence in the room. They would waken in"
"3134",140,"the midnight hours, when everything was black; perhaps they would hear"
"3135",140,"it yelling outside, or perhaps there would be deathlike stillness--and"
"3136",140,"that would be worse yet. They could feel the cold as it crept in through"
"3137",140,"the cracks, reaching out for them with its icy, death-dealing fingers;"
"3138",140,"and they would crouch and cower, and try to hide from it, all in vain."
"3139",140,"It would come, and it would come; a grisly thing, a specter born in"
"3140",140,"the black caverns of terror; a power primeval, cosmic, shadowing the"
"3141",140,"tortures of the lost souls flung out to chaos and destruction. It was"
"3142",140,"cruel iron-hard; and hour after hour they would cringe in its grasp,"
"3143",140,"alone, alone. There would be no one to hear them if they cried out;"
"3144",140,"there would be no help, no mercy. And so on until morning--when they"
"3145",140,"would go out to another day of toil, a little weaker, a little nearer to"
"3146",140,"the time when it would be their turn to be shaken from the tree."

"3152",140,""
"3153",140,"Yet even by this deadly winter the germ of hope was not to be kept"
"3154",140,"from sprouting in their hearts. It was just at this time that the great"
"3155",140,"adventure befell Marija."
"3156",140,""
"3157",140,"The victim was Tamoszius Kuszleika, who played the violin. Everybody"
"3158",140,"laughed at them, for Tamoszius was petite and frail, and Marija could"
"3159",140,"have picked him up and carried him off under one arm. But perhaps that"
"3160",140,"was why she fascinated him; the sheer volume of Marija's energy was"
"3161",140,"overwhelming. That first night at the wedding Tamoszius had hardly taken"
"3162",140,"his eyes off her; and later on, when he came to find that she had really"
"3163",140,"the heart of a baby, her voice and her violence ceased to terrify him,"
"3164",140,"and he got the habit of coming to pay her visits on Sunday afternoons."
"3165",140,"There was no place to entertain company except in the kitchen, in the"
"3166",140,"midst of the family, and Tamoszius would sit there with his hat between"
"3167",140,"his knees, never saying more than half a dozen words at a time, and"
"3168",140,"turning red in the face before he managed to say those; until finally"
"3169",140,"Jurgis would clap him upon the back, in his hearty way, crying, ""Come"
"3170",140,"now, brother, give us a tune."" And then Tamoszius' face would light up"
"3171",140,"and he would get out his fiddle, tuck it under his chin, and play. And"
"3172",140,"forthwith the soul of him would flame up and become eloquent--it was"
"3173",140,"almost an impropriety, for all the while his gaze would be fixed upon"
"3174",140,"Marija's face, until she would begin to turn red and lower her eyes."
"3175",140,"There was no resisting the music of Tamoszius, however; even the"
"3176",140,"children would sit awed and wondering, and the tears would run down Teta"
"3177",140,"Elzbieta's cheeks. A wonderful privilege it was to be thus admitted into"
"3178",140,"the soul of a man of genius, to be allowed to share the ecstasies and"
"3179",140,"the agonies of his inmost life."
"3180",140,""
"3181",140,"Then there were other benefits accruing to Marija from this"
"3182",140,"friendship--benefits of a more substantial nature. People paid Tamoszius"
"3183",140,"big money to come and make music on state occasions; and also they"
"3184",140,"would invite him to parties and festivals, knowing well that he was too"
"3185",140,"good-natured to come without his fiddle, and that having brought it,"
"3186",140,"he could be made to play while others danced. Once he made bold to ask"
"3187",140,"Marija to accompany him to such a party, and Marija accepted, to his"
"3188",140,"great delight--after which he never went anywhere without her, while if"
"3189",140,"the celebration were given by friends of his, he would invite the rest"
"3190",140,"of the family also. In any case Marija would bring back a huge pocketful"
"3191",140,"of cakes and sandwiches for the children, and stories of all the good"
"3192",140,"things she herself had managed to consume. She was compelled, at these"
"3193",140,"parties, to spend most of her time at the refreshment table, for she"
"3194",140,"could not dance with anybody except other women and very old men;"
"3195",140,"Tamoszius was of an excitable temperament, and afflicted with a frantic"
"3196",140,"jealousy, and any unmarried man who ventured to put his arm about the"
"3197",140,"ample waist of Marija would be certain to throw the orchestra out of"
"3198",140,"tune."
"3199",140,""
"3200",140,"It was a great help to a person who had to toil all the week to be able"
"3201",140,"to look forward to some such relaxation as this on Saturday nights. The"
"3202",140,"family was too poor and too hardworked to make many acquaintances;"
"3203",140,"in Packingtown, as a rule, people know only their near neighbors and"
"3204",140,"shopmates, and so the place is like a myriad of little country villages."
"3205",140,"But now there was a member of the family who was permitted to travel and"
"3206",140,"widen her horizon; and so each week there would be new personalities to"
"3207",140,"talk about,--how so-and-so was dressed, and where she worked, and what"
"3208",140,"she got, and whom she was in love with; and how this man had jilted his"
"3209",140,"girl, and how she had quarreled with the other girl, and what had passed"
"3210",140,"between them; and how another man beat his wife, and spent all her"
"3211",140,"earnings upon drink, and pawned her very clothes. Some people would have"
"3212",140,"scorned this talk as gossip; but then one has to talk about what one"
"3213",140,"knows."
"3214",140,""
"3215",140,"It was one Saturday night, as they were coming home from a wedding, that"
"3216",140,"Tamoszius found courage, and set down his violin case in the street and"
"3217",140,"spoke his heart; and then Marija clasped him in her arms. She told them"
"3218",140,"all about it the next day, and fairly cried with happiness, for she said"
"3219",140,"that Tamoszius was a lovely man. After that he no longer made love"
"3220",140,"to her with his fiddle, but they would sit for hours in the kitchen,"
"3221",140,"blissfully happy in each other's arms; it was the tacit convention of"
"3222",140,"the family to know nothing of what was going on in that corner."
"3223",140,""
"3224",140,"They were planning to be married in the spring, and have the garret"

"3226",140,"little by little the family were paying back their debt to Marija,"
"3227",140,"so she ought soon to have enough to start life upon--only, with her"
"3228",140,"preposterous softheartedness, she would insist upon spending a good part"
"3229",140,"of her money every week for things which she saw they needed. Marija"
"3230",140,"was really the capitalist of the party, for she had become an expert can"
"3231",140,"painter by this time--she was getting fourteen cents for every hundred"
"3232",140,"and ten cans, and she could paint more than two cans every minute."
"3233",140,"Marija felt, so to speak, that she had her hand on the throttle, and the"
"3234",140,"neighborhood was vocal with her rejoicings."
"3235",140,""
"3236",140,"Yet her friends would shake their heads and tell her to go slow; one"
"3237",140,"could not count upon such good fortune forever--there were accidents"
"3238",140,"that always happened. But Marija was not to be prevailed upon, and went"
"3239",140,"on planning and dreaming of all the treasures she was going to have for"
"3240",140,"her home; and so, when the crash did come, her grief was painful to see."
"3241",140,""
"3242",140,"For her canning factory shut down! Marija would about as soon have"
"3243",140,"expected to see the sun shut down--the huge establishment had been to"
"3244",140,"her a thing akin to the planets and the seasons. But now it was shut!"
"3245",140,"And they had not given her any explanation, they had not even given her"
"3246",140,"a day's warning; they had simply posted a notice one Saturday that all"
"3247",140,"hands would be paid off that afternoon, and would not resume work for at"
"3248",140,"least a month! And that was all that there was to it--her job was gone!"
"3249",140,""
"3250",140,"It was the holiday rush that was over, the girls said in answer to"
"3251",140,"Marija's inquiries; after that there was always a slack. Sometimes the"
"3252",140,"factory would start up on half time after a while, but there was no"
"3253",140,"telling--it had been known to stay closed until way into the summer. The"
"3254",140,"prospects were bad at present, for truckmen who worked in the storerooms"
"3255",140,"said that these were piled up to the ceilings, so that the firm could"
"3256",140,"not have found room for another week's output of cans. And they had"
"3257",140,"turned off three-quarters of these men, which was a still worse sign,"
"3258",140,"since it meant that there were no orders to be filled. It was all a"
"3259",140,"swindle, can-painting, said the girls--you were crazy with delight"
"3260",140,"because you were making twelve or fourteen dollars a week, and saving"
"3261",140,"half of it; but you had to spend it all keeping alive while you were"
"3262",140,"out, and so your pay was really only half what you thought."
"3263",140,""
"3264",140,""
"3265",140,"Marija came home, and because she was a person who could not rest"
"3266",140,"without danger of explosion, they first had a great house cleaning, and"
"3267",140,"then she set out to search Packingtown for a job to fill up the gap. As"
"3268",140,"nearly all the canning establishments were shut down, and all the girls"
"3269",140,"hunting work, it will be readily understood that Marija did not find"
"3270",140,"any. Then she took to trying the stores and saloons, and when this"
"3271",140,"failed she even traveled over into the far-distant regions near the lake"
"3272",140,"front, where lived the rich people in great palaces, and begged there"
"3273",140,"for some sort of work that could be done by a person who did not know"
"3274",140,"English."
"3275",140,""
"3276",140,"The men upon the killing beds felt also the effects of the slump which"
"3277",140,"had turned Marija out; but they felt it in a different way, and a way"
"3278",140,"which made Jurgis understand at last all their bitterness. The big"
"3279",140,"packers did not turn their hands off and close down, like the canning"
"3280",140,"factories; but they began to run for shorter and shorter hours. They had"
"3281",140,"always required the men to be on the killing beds and ready for work at"
"3282",140,"seven o'clock, although there was almost never any work to be done till"
"3283",140,"the buyers out in the yards had gotten to work, and some cattle had come"
"3284",140,"over the chutes. That would often be ten or eleven o'clock, which was"
"3285",140,"bad enough, in all conscience; but now, in the slack season, they would"
"3286",140,"perhaps not have a thing for their men to do till late in the afternoon."
"3287",140,"And so they would have to loaf around, in a place where the thermometer"
"3288",140,"might be twenty degrees below zero! At first one would see them running"
"3289",140,"about, or skylarking with each other, trying to keep warm; but before"
"3290",140,"the day was over they would become quite chilled through and exhausted,"
"3291",140,"and, when the cattle finally came, so near frozen that to move was an"
"3292",140,"agony. And then suddenly the place would spring into activity, and the"
"3293",140,"merciless ""speeding-up"" would begin!"
"3294",140,""
"3295",140,"There were weeks at a time when Jurgis went home after such a day as"
"3296",140,"this with not more than two hours' work to his credit--which meant about"
"3297",140,"thirty-five cents. There were many days when the total was less than"
"3298",140,"half an hour, and others when there was none at all. The general average"
"3299",140,"was six hours a day, which meant for Jurgis about six dollars a week;"
"3300",140,"and this six hours of work would be done after standing on the killing"
"3301",140,"bed till one o'clock, or perhaps even three or four o'clock, in the"
"3302",140,"afternoon. Like as not there would come a rush of cattle at the very"
"3303",140,"end of the day, which the men would have to dispose of before they went"
"3304",140,"home, often working by electric light till nine or ten, or even twelve"
"3305",140,"or one o'clock, and without a single instant for a bite of supper. The"
"3306",140,"men were at the mercy of the cattle. Perhaps the buyers would be holding"
"3307",140,"off for better prices--if they could scare the shippers into thinking"
"3308",140,"that they meant to buy nothing that day, they could get their own terms."
"3309",140,"For some reason the cost of fodder for cattle in the yards was much"
"3310",140,"above the market price--and you were not allowed to bring your own"
"3311",140,"fodder! Then, too, a number of cars were apt to arrive late in the day,"
"3312",140,"now that the roads were blocked with snow, and the packers would buy"
"3313",140,"their cattle that night, to get them cheaper, and then would come into"
"3314",140,"play their ironclad rule, that all cattle must be killed the same day"
"3315",140,"they were bought. There was no use kicking about this--there had been"
"3316",140,"one delegation after another to see the packers about it, only to be"
"3317",140,"told that it was the rule, and that there was not the slightest chance"
"3318",140,"of its ever being altered. And so on Christmas Eve Jurgis worked till"
"3319",140,"nearly one o'clock in the morning, and on Christmas Day he was on the"
"3320",140,"killing bed at seven o'clock."
"3321",140,""
"3322",140,"All this was bad; and yet it was not the worst. For after all the hard"
"3323",140,"work a man did, he was paid for only part of it. Jurgis had once been"
"3324",140,"among those who scoffed at the idea of these huge concerns cheating;"
"3325",140,"and so now he could appreciate the bitter irony of the fact that it was"
"3326",140,"precisely their size which enabled them to do it with impunity. One of"
"3327",140,"the rules on the killing beds was that a man who was one minute late"
"3328",140,"was docked an hour; and this was economical, for he was made to work the"
"3329",140,"balance of the hour--he was not allowed to stand round and wait. And on"
"3330",140,"the other hand if he came ahead of time he got no pay for that--though"
"3331",140,"often the bosses would start up the gang ten or fifteen minutes before"
"3332",140,"the whistle. And this same custom they carried over to the end of the"
"3333",140,"day; they did not pay for any fraction of an hour--for ""broken time."" A"
"3334",140,"man might work full fifty minutes, but if there was no work to fill out"
"3335",140,"the hour, there was no pay for him. Thus the end of every day was a"
"3336",140,"sort of lottery--a struggle, all but breaking into open war between"
"3337",140,"the bosses and the men, the former trying to rush a job through and"
"3338",140,"the latter trying to stretch it out. Jurgis blamed the bosses for this,"
"3339",140,"though the truth to be told it was not always their fault; for the"
"3340",140,"packers kept them frightened for their lives--and when one was in danger"
"3341",140,"of falling behind the standard, what was easier than to catch up"
"3342",140,"by making the gang work awhile ""for the church""? This was a savage"
"3343",140,"witticism the men had, which Jurgis had to have explained to him. Old"
"3344",140,"man Jones was great on missions and such things, and so whenever they"
"3345",140,"were doing some particularly disreputable job, the men would wink at"
"3346",140,"each other and say, ""Now we're working for the church!"""
"3347",140,""
"3348",140,"One of the consequences of all these things was that Jurgis was no"
"3349",140,"longer perplexed when he heard men talk of fighting for their rights."
"3350",140,"He felt like fighting now himself; and when the Irish delegate of the"
"3351",140,"butcher-helpers' union came to him a second time, he received him in a"
"3352",140,"far different spirit. A wonderful idea it now seemed to Jurgis, this"
"3353",140,"of the men--that by combining they might be able to make a stand and"
"3354",140,"conquer the packers! Jurgis wondered who had first thought of it; and"
"3355",140,"when he was told that it was a common thing for men to do in America, he"
"3356",140,"got the first inkling of a meaning in the phrase ""a free country."" The"
"3357",140,"delegate explained to him how it depended upon their being able to get"
"3358",140,"every man to join and stand by the organization, and so Jurgis signified"
"3359",140,"that he was willing to do his share. Before another month was by, all"
"3360",140,"the working members of his family had union cards, and wore their union"
"3361",140,"buttons conspicuously and with pride. For fully a week they were quite"
"3362",140,"blissfully happy, thinking that belonging to a union meant an end to all"
"3363",140,"their troubles."
"3364",140,""
"3365",140,"But only ten days after she had joined, Marija's canning factory closed"
"3366",140,"down, and that blow quite staggered them. They could not understand why"
"3367",140,"the union had not prevented it, and the very first time she attended"
"3368",140,"a meeting Marija got up and made a speech about it. It was a business"
"3369",140,"meeting, and was transacted in English, but that made no difference to"
"3370",140,"Marija; she said what was in her, and all the pounding of the chairman's"
"3371",140,"gavel and all the uproar and confusion in the room could not prevail."
"3372",140,"Quite apart from her own troubles she was boiling over with a general"
"3373",140,"sense of the injustice of it, and she told what she thought of the"
"3374",140,"packers, and what she thought of a world where such things were allowed"
"3375",140,"to happen; and then, while the echoes of the hall rang with the shock"
"3376",140,"of her terrible voice, she sat down again and fanned herself, and the"
"3377",140,"meeting gathered itself together and proceeded to discuss the election"
"3378",140,"of a recording secretary."
"3379",140,""
"3380",140,"Jurgis too had an adventure the first time he attended a union meeting,"
"3381",140,"but it was not of his own seeking. Jurgis had gone with the desire"
"3382",140,"to get into an inconspicuous corner and see what was done; but this"
"3383",140,"attitude of silent and open-eyed attention had marked him out for a"
"3384",140,"victim. Tommy Finnegan was a little Irishman, with big staring eyes and"
"3385",140,"a wild aspect, a ""hoister"" by trade, and badly cracked. Somewhere back"
"3386",140,"in the far-distant past Tommy Finnegan had had a strange experience,"
"3387",140,"and the burden of it rested upon him. All the balance of his life he had"
"3388",140,"done nothing but try to make it understood. When he talked he caught"
"3389",140,"his victim by the buttonhole, and his face kept coming closer and"
"3390",140,"closer--which was trying, because his teeth were so bad. Jurgis did not"
"3391",140,"mind that, only he was frightened. The method of operation of the higher"
"3392",140,"intelligences was Tom Finnegan's theme, and he desired to find out if"
"3393",140,"Jurgis had ever considered that the representation of things in their"
"3394",140,"present similarity might be altogether unintelligible upon a more"
"3395",140,"elevated plane. There were assuredly wonderful mysteries about the"
"3396",140,"developing of these things; and then, becoming confidential, Mr."
"3397",140,"Finnegan proceeded to tell of some discoveries of his own. ""If ye have"
"3398",140,"iver had onything to do wid shperrits,"" said he, and looked inquiringly"
"3399",140,"at Jurgis, who kept shaking his head. ""Niver mind, niver mind,"""
"3400",140,"continued the other, ""but their influences may be operatin' upon ye;"
"3401",140,"it's shure as I'm tellin' ye, it's them that has the reference to the"
"3402",140,"immejit surroundin's that has the most of power. It was vouchsafed to"
"3403",140,"me in me youthful days to be acquainted with shperrits"" and so"
"3404",140,"Tommy Finnegan went on, expounding a system of philosophy, while the"
"3405",140,"perspiration came out on Jurgis' forehead, so great was his agitation"
"3406",140,"and embarrassment. In the end one of the men, seeing his plight, came"
"3407",140,"over and rescued him; but it was some time before he was able to find"
"3408",140,"any one to explain things to him, and meanwhile his fear lest the"
"3409",140,"strange little Irishman should get him cornered again was enough to keep"
"3410",140,"him dodging about the room the whole evening."
"3411",140,""
"3412",140,"He never missed a meeting, however. He had picked up a few words of"
"3413",140,"English by this time, and friends would help him to understand. They"
"3414",140,"were often very turbulent meetings, with half a dozen men declaiming"
"3415",140,"at once, in as many dialects of English; but the speakers were all"
"3416",140,"desperately in earnest, and Jurgis was in earnest too, for he understood"
"3417",140,"that a fight was on, and that it was his fight. Since the time of his"
"3418",140,"disillusionment, Jurgis had sworn to trust no man, except in his own"
"3419",140,"family; but here he discovered that he had brothers in affliction, and"
"3420",140,"allies. Their one chance for life was in union, and so the struggle"
"3421",140,"became a kind of crusade. Jurgis had always been a member of the church,"
"3422",140,"because it was the right thing to be, but the church had never"
"3423",140,"touched him, he left all that for the women. Here, however, was a new"
"3424",140,"religion--one that did touch him, that took hold of every fiber of him;"
"3425",140,"and with all the zeal and fury of a convert he went out as a missionary."
"3426",140,"There were many nonunion men among the Lithuanians, and with these"
"3427",140,"he would labor and wrestle in prayer, trying to show them the right."
"3428",140,"Sometimes they would be obstinate and refuse to see it, and Jurgis,"
"3429",140,"alas, was not always patient! He forgot how he himself had been blind,"
"3430",140,"a short time ago--after the fashion of all crusaders since the original"
"3431",140,"ones, who set out to spread the gospel of Brotherhood by force of arms."

"3436",140,""
"3437",140,""
"3438",140,"One of the first consequences of the discovery of the union was that"
"3439",140,"Jurgis became desirous of learning English. He wanted to know what was"
"3440",140,"going on at the meetings, and to be able to take part in them, and so he"
"3441",140,"began to look about him, and to try to pick up words. The children, who"
"3442",140,"were at school, and learning fast, would teach him a few; and a friend"
"3443",140,"loaned him a little book that had some in it, and Ona would read them to"
"3444",140,"him. Then Jurgis became sorry that he could not read himself; and later"
"3445",140,"on in the winter, when some one told him that there was a night school"
"3446",140,"that was free, he went and enrolled. After that, every evening that he"
"3447",140,"got home from the yards in time, he would go to the school; he would go"
"3448",140,"even if he were in time for only half an hour. They were teaching him"
"3449",140,"both to read and to speak English--and they would have taught him other"
"3450",140,"things, if only he had had a little time."
"3451",140,""
"3452",140,"Also the union made another great difference with him--it made him begin"
"3453",140,"to pay attention to the country. It was the beginning of democracy with"
"3454",140,"him. It was a little state, the union, a miniature republic; its affairs"
"3455",140,"were every man's affairs, and every man had a real say about them. In"
"3456",140,"other words, in the union Jurgis learned to talk politics. In the place"
"3457",140,"where he had come from there had not been any politics--in Russia one"
"3458",140,"thought of the government as an affliction like the lightning and the"
"3459",140,"hail. ""Duck, little brother, duck,"" the wise old peasants would whisper;"
"3460",140,"""everything passes away."" And when Jurgis had first come to America he"
"3461",140,"had supposed that it was the same. He had heard people say that it was"
"3462",140,"a free country--but what did that mean? He found that here, precisely"
"3463",140,"as in Russia, there were rich men who owned everything; and if one could"
"3464",140,"not find any work, was not the hunger he began to feel the same sort of"
"3465",140,"hunger?"
"3466",140,""
"3467",140,"When Jurgis had been working about three weeks at Brown's, there had"
"3468",140,"come to him one noontime a man who was employed as a night watchman, and"
"3469",140,"who asked him if he would not like to take out naturalization papers"
"3470",140,"and become a citizen. Jurgis did not know what that meant, but the man"
"3471",140,"explained the advantages. In the first place, it would not cost him"
"3472",140,"anything, and it would get him half a day off, with his pay just the"
"3473",140,"same; and then when election time came he would be able to vote--and"
"3474",140,"there was something in that. Jurgis was naturally glad to accept, and so"
"3475",140,"the night watchman said a few words to the boss, and he was excused for"
"3476",140,"the rest of the day. When, later on, he wanted a holiday to get married"
"3477",140,"he could not get it; and as for a holiday with pay just the same--what"
"3478",140,"power had wrought that miracle heaven only knew! However, he went with"
"3479",140,"the man, who picked up several other newly landed immigrants, Poles,"
"3480",140,"Lithuanians, and Slovaks, and took them all outside, where stood a great"
"3481",140,"four-horse tallyho coach, with fifteen or twenty men already in it. It"
"3482",140,"was a fine chance to see the sights of the city, and the party had a"
"3483",140,"merry time, with plenty of beer handed up from inside. So they drove"
"3484",140,"downtown and stopped before an imposing granite building, in which they"
"3485",140,"interviewed an official, who had the papers all ready, with only the"
"3486",140,"names to be filled in. So each man in turn took an oath of which he did"
"3487",140,"not understand a word, and then was presented with a handsome ornamented"
"3488",140,"document with a big red seal and the shield of the United States upon"
"3489",140,"it, and was told that he had become a citizen of the Republic and the"
"3490",140,"equal of the President himself."
"3491",140,""
"3492",140,"A month or two later Jurgis had another interview with this same man,"
"3493",140,"who told him where to go to ""register."" And then finally, when election"
"3494",140,"day came, the packing houses posted a notice that men who desired to"
"3495",140,"vote might remain away until nine that morning, and the same night"
"3496",140,"watchman took Jurgis and the rest of his flock into the back room of a"
"3497",140,"saloon, and showed each of them where and how to mark a ballot, and then"
"3498",140,"gave each two dollars, and took them to the polling place, where there"
"3499",140,"was a policeman on duty especially to see that they got through all"
"3500",140,"right. Jurgis felt quite proud of this good luck till he got home and"
"3501",140,"met Jonas, who had taken the leader aside and whispered to him, offering"
"3502",140,"to vote three times for four dollars, which offer had been accepted."
"3503",140,""
"3504",140,"And now in the union Jurgis met men who explained all this mystery"
"3505",140,"to him; and he learned that America differed from Russia in that its"
"3506",140,"government existed under the form of a democracy. The officials who"
"3507",140,"ruled it, and got all the graft, had to be elected first; and so there"
"3508",140,"were two rival sets of grafters, known as political parties, and the one"
"3509",140,"got the office which bought the most votes. Now and then, the election"
"3510",140,"was very close, and that was the time the poor man came in. In the"
"3511",140,"stockyards this was only in national and state elections, for in local"
"3512",140,"elections the Democratic Party always carried everything. The ruler of"
"3513",140,"the district was therefore the Democratic boss, a little Irishman named"
"3514",140,"Mike Scully. Scully held an important party office in the state, and"
"3515",140,"bossed even the mayor of the city, it was said; it was his boast that he"
"3516",140,"carried the stockyards in his pocket. He was an enormously rich man--he"
"3517",140,"had a hand in all the big graft in the neighborhood. It was Scully, for"
"3518",140,"instance, who owned that dump which Jurgis and Ona had seen the first"
"3519",140,"day of their arrival. Not only did he own the dump, but he owned the"
"3520",140,"brick factory as well, and first he took out the clay and made it into"
"3521",140,"bricks, and then he had the city bring garbage to fill up the hole, so"
"3522",140,"that he could build houses to sell to the people. Then, too, he sold the"
"3523",140,"bricks to the city, at his own price, and the city came and got them"
"3524",140,"in its own wagons. And also he owned the other hole near by, where the"
"3525",140,"stagnant water was; and it was he who cut the ice and sold it; and what"
"3526",140,"was more, if the men told truth, he had not had to pay any taxes for the"
"3527",140,"water, and he had built the ice-house out of city lumber, and had not had"
"3528",140,"to pay anything for that. The newspapers had got hold of that story, and"
"3529",140,"there had been a scandal; but Scully had hired somebody to confess and"
"3530",140,"take all the blame, and then skip the country. It was said, too, that he"
"3531",140,"had built his brick-kiln in the same way, and that the workmen were on"
"3532",140,"the city payroll while they did it; however, one had to press closely to"
"3533",140,"get these things out of the men, for it was not their business, and Mike"
"3534",140,"Scully was a good man to stand in with. A note signed by him was equal"
"3535",140,"to a job any time at the packing houses; and also he employed a good"
"3536",140,"many men himself, and worked them only eight hours a day, and paid them"
"3537",140,"the highest wages. This gave him many friends--all of whom he had gotten"
"3538",140,"together into the ""War Whoop League,"" whose clubhouse you might see"
"3539",140,"just outside of the yards. It was the biggest clubhouse, and the biggest"
"3540",140,"club, in all Chicago; and they had prizefights every now and then,"
"3541",140,"and cockfights and even dogfights. The policemen in the district all"
"3542",140,"belonged to the league, and instead of suppressing the fights, they sold"
"3543",140,"tickets for them. The man that had taken Jurgis to be naturalized was"
"3544",140,"one of these ""Indians,"" as they were called; and on election day there"
"3545",140,"would be hundreds of them out, and all with big wads of money in their"
"3546",140,"pockets and free drinks at every saloon in the district. That was"
"3547",140,"another thing, the men said--all the saloon-keepers had to be ""Indians,"""
"3548",140,"and to put up on demand, otherwise they could not do business on"
"3549",140,"Sundays, nor have any gambling at all. In the same way Scully had all"
"3550",140,"the jobs in the fire department at his disposal, and all the rest of the"
"3551",140,"city graft in the stockyards district; he was building a block of flats"
"3552",140,"somewhere up on Ashland Avenue, and the man who was overseeing it for"
"3553",140,"him was drawing pay as a city inspector of sewers. The city inspector of"
"3554",140,"water pipes had been dead and buried for over a year, but somebody was"
"3555",140,"still drawing his pay. The city inspector of sidewalks was a barkeeper"
"3556",140,"at the War Whoop Cafe--and maybe he could make it uncomfortable for any"
"3557",140,"tradesman who did not stand in with Scully!"
"3558",140,""
"3559",140,"Even the packers were in awe of him, so the men said. It gave them"
"3560",140,"pleasure to believe this, for Scully stood as the people's man, and"
"3561",140,"boasted of it boldly when election day came. The packers had wanted a"
"3562",140,"bridge at Ashland Avenue, but they had not been able to get it till they"
"3563",140,"had seen Scully; and it was the same with ""Bubbly Creek,"" which the city"
"3564",140,"had threatened to make the packers cover over, till Scully had come to"
"3565",140,"their aid. ""Bubbly Creek"" is an arm of the Chicago River, and forms the"
"3566",140,"southern boundary of the yards: all the drainage of the square mile of"
"3567",140,"packing houses empties into it, so that it is really a great open sewer"
"3568",140,"a hundred or two feet wide. One long arm of it is blind, and the filth"
"3569",140,"stays there forever and a day. The grease and chemicals that are poured"
"3570",140,"into it undergo all sorts of strange transformations, which are the"
"3571",140,"cause of its name; it is constantly in motion, as if huge fish were"
"3572",140,"feeding in it, or great leviathans disporting themselves in its depths."
"3573",140,"Bubbles of carbonic acid gas will rise to the surface and burst, and"
"3574",140,"make rings two or three feet wide. Here and there the grease and filth"
"3575",140,"have caked solid, and the creek looks like a bed of lava; chickens walk"
"3576",140,"about on it, feeding, and many times an unwary stranger has started to"
"3577",140,"stroll across, and vanished temporarily. The packers used to leave the"
"3578",140,"creek that way, till every now and then the surface would catch on fire"
"3579",140,"and burn furiously, and the fire department would have to come and put"
"3580",140,"it out. Once, however, an ingenious stranger came and started to gather"
"3581",140,"this filth in scows, to make lard out of; then the packers took the"
"3582",140,"cue, and got out an injunction to stop him, and afterward gathered it"
"3583",140,"themselves. The banks of ""Bubbly Creek"" are plastered thick with hairs,"
"3584",140,"and this also the packers gather and clean."
"3585",140,""
"3586",140,"And there were things even stranger than this, according to the gossip"
"3587",140,"of the men. The packers had secret mains, through which they stole"
"3588",140,"billions of gallons of the city's water. The newspapers had been full of"
"3589",140,"this scandal--once there had even been an investigation, and an actual"
"3590",140,"uncovering of the pipes; but nobody had been punished, and the thing"
"3591",140,"went right on. And then there was the condemned meat industry, with its"
"3592",140,"endless horrors. The people of Chicago saw the government inspectors"
"3593",140,"in Packingtown, and they all took that to mean that they were protected"
"3594",140,"from diseased meat; they did not understand that these hundred and"
"3595",140,"sixty-three inspectors had been appointed at the request of the packers,"
"3596",140,"and that they were paid by the United States government to certify"
"3597",140,"that all the diseased meat was kept in the state. They had no authority"
"3598",140,"beyond that; for the inspection of meat to be sold in the city and state"
"3599",140,"the whole force in Packingtown consisted of three henchmen of the local"
"3600",140,"political machine!*"

"3636",140,"there has not been even a pretense of any interference with the graft."
"3637",140,"There was said to be two thousand dollars a week hush money from the"
"3638",140,"tubercular steers alone; and as much again from the hogs which had died"
"3639",140,"of cholera on the trains, and which you might see any day being loaded"
"3640",140,"into boxcars and hauled away to a place called Globe, in Indiana, where"
"3641",140,"they made a fancy grade of lard."
"3642",140,""
"3643",140,"Jurgis heard of these things little by little, in the gossip of those"
"3644",140,"who were obliged to perpetrate them. It seemed as if every time you"
"3645",140,"met a person from a new department, you heard of new swindles and new"
"3646",140,"crimes. There was, for instance, a Lithuanian who was a cattle butcher"
"3647",140,"for the plant where Marija had worked, which killed meat for canning"
"3648",140,"only; and to hear this man describe the animals which came to his place"
"3649",140,"would have been worthwhile for a Dante or a Zola. It seemed that they"
"3650",140,"must have agencies all over the country, to hunt out old and crippled"
"3651",140,"and diseased cattle to be canned. There were cattle which had been fed"
"3652",140,"on ""whisky-malt,"" the refuse of the breweries, and had become what the"
"3653",140,"men called ""steerly""--which means covered with boils. It was a nasty"
"3654",140,"job killing these, for when you plunged your knife into them they would"
"3655",140,"burst and splash foul-smelling stuff into your face; and when a man's"
"3656",140,"sleeves were smeared with blood, and his hands steeped in it, how was he"
"3657",140,"ever to wipe his face, or to clear his eyes so that he could see? It was"
"3658",140,"stuff such as this that made the ""embalmed beef"" that had killed"
"3659",140,"several times as many United States soldiers as all the bullets of the"
"3660",140,"Spaniards; only the army beef, besides, was not fresh canned, it was old"
"3661",140,"stuff that had been lying for years in the cellars."
"3662",140,""
"3663",140,"Then one Sunday evening, Jurgis sat puffing his pipe by the kitchen"
"3664",140,"stove, and talking with an old fellow whom Jonas had introduced, and"
"3665",140,"who worked in the canning rooms at Durham's; and so Jurgis learned a few"
"3666",140,"things about the great and only Durham canned goods, which had become"
"3667",140,"a national institution. They were regular alchemists at Durham's; they"
"3668",140,"advertised a mushroom-catsup, and the men who made it did not know what"
"3669",140,"a mushroom looked like. They advertised ""potted chicken,""--and it was"
"3670",140,"like the boardinghouse soup of the comic papers, through which a chicken"
"3671",140,"had walked with rubbers on. Perhaps they had a secret process for making"
"3672",140,"chickens chemically--who knows? said Jurgis' friend; the things that"
"3673",140,"went into the mixture were tripe, and the fat of pork, and beef suet,"
"3674",140,"and hearts of beef, and finally the waste ends of veal, when they had"
"3675",140,"any. They put these up in several grades, and sold them at several"
"3676",140,"prices; but the contents of the cans all came out of the same hopper."
"3677",140,"And then there was ""potted game"" and ""potted grouse,"" ""potted ham,"" and"
"3678",140,"""deviled ham""--de-vyled, as the men called it. ""De-vyled"" ham was made"
"3679",140,"out of the waste ends of smoked beef that were too small to be sliced by"
"3680",140,"the machines; and also tripe, dyed with chemicals so that it would not"
"3681",140,"show white; and trimmings of hams and corned beef; and potatoes, skins"
"3682",140,"and all; and finally the hard cartilaginous gullets of beef, after the"
"3683",140,"tongues had been cut out. All this ingenious mixture was ground up and"
"3684",140,"flavored with spices to make it taste like something. Anybody who could"
"3685",140,"invent a new imitation had been sure of a fortune from old Durham, said"
"3686",140,"Jurgis' informant; but it was hard to think of anything new in a"
"3687",140,"place where so many sharp wits had been at work for so long; where men"
"3688",140,"welcomed tuberculosis in the cattle they were feeding, because it made"
"3689",140,"them fatten more quickly; and where they bought up all the old rancid"
"3690",140,"butter left over in the grocery stores of a continent, and ""oxidized"" it"
"3691",140,"by a forced-air process, to take away the odor, rechurned it with skim"
"3692",140,"milk, and sold it in bricks in the cities! Up to a year or two ago"
"3693",140,"it had been the custom to kill horses in the yards--ostensibly for"
"3694",140,"fertilizer; but after long agitation the newspapers had been able to"
"3695",140,"make the public realize that the horses were being canned. Now it was"
"3696",140,"against the law to kill horses in Packingtown, and the law was really"
"3697",140,"complied with--for the present, at any rate. Any day, however, one might"
"3698",140,"see sharp-horned and shaggy-haired creatures running with the sheep and"
"3699",140,"yet what a job you would have to get the public to believe that a good"
"3700",140,"part of what it buys for lamb and mutton is really goat's flesh!"
"3701",140,""
"3702",140,"There was another interesting set of statistics that a person might"
"3703",140,"have gathered in Packingtown--those of the various afflictions of"
"3704",140,"the workers. When Jurgis had first inspected the packing plants with"
"3705",140,"Szedvilas, he had marveled while he listened to the tale of all the"
"3706",140,"things that were made out of the carcasses of animals, and of all the"
"3707",140,"lesser industries that were maintained there; now he found that each one"
"3708",140,"of these lesser industries was a separate little inferno, in its way as"
"3709",140,"horrible as the killing beds, the source and fountain of them all."
"3710",140,"The workers in each of them had their own peculiar diseases. And the"
"3711",140,"wandering visitor might be skeptical about all the swindles, but he"
"3712",140,"could not be skeptical about these, for the worker bore the evidence"
"3713",140,"of them about on his own person--generally he had only to hold out his"
"3714",140,"hand."
"3715",140,""
"3716",140,"There were the men in the pickle rooms, for instance, where old Antanas"
"3717",140,"had gotten his death; scarce a one of these that had not some spot of"
"3718",140,"horror on his person. Let a man so much as scrape his finger pushing a"
"3719",140,"truck in the pickle rooms, and he might have a sore that would put him"
"3720",140,"out of the world; all the joints in his fingers might be eaten by the"
"3721",140,"acid, one by one. Of the butchers and floorsmen, the beef-boners and"
"3722",140,"trimmers, and all those who used knives, you could scarcely find a"
"3723",140,"person who had the use of his thumb; time and time again the base of it"
"3724",140,"had been slashed, till it was a mere lump of flesh against which the"
"3725",140,"man pressed the knife to hold it. The hands of these men would be"
"3726",140,"criss-crossed with cuts, until you could no longer pretend to count"
"3727",140,"them or to trace them. They would have no nails,--they had worn them off"
"3728",140,"pulling hides; their knuckles were swollen so that their fingers spread"
"3729",140,"out like a fan. There were men who worked in the cooking rooms, in the"
"3730",140,"midst of steam and sickening odors, by artificial light; in these rooms"
"3731",140,"the germs of tuberculosis might live for two years, but the supply"
"3732",140,"was renewed every hour. There were the beef-luggers, who carried"
"3733",140,"two-hundred-pound quarters into the refrigerator-cars; a fearful kind of"
"3734",140,"work, that began at four o'clock in the morning, and that wore out the"
"3735",140,"most powerful men in a few years. There were those who worked in the"
"3736",140,"chilling rooms, and whose special disease was rheumatism; the time limit"
"3737",140,"that a man could work in the chilling rooms was said to be five years."
"3738",140,"There were the wool-pluckers, whose hands went to pieces even sooner"
"3739",140,"than the hands of the pickle men; for the pelts of the sheep had to be"
"3740",140,"painted with acid to loosen the wool, and then the pluckers had to"
"3741",140,"pull out this wool with their bare hands, till the acid had eaten their"
"3742",140,"fingers off. There were those who made the tins for the canned meat; and"
"3743",140,"their hands, too, were a maze of cuts, and each cut represented a chance"
"3744",140,"for blood poisoning. Some worked at the stamping machines, and it was"
"3745",140,"very seldom that one could work long there at the pace that was set, and"
"3746",140,"not give out and forget himself and have a part of his hand chopped off."
"3747",140,"There were the ""hoisters,"" as they were called, whose task it was to"
"3748",140,"press the lever which lifted the dead cattle off the floor. They ran"
"3749",140,"along upon a rafter, peering down through the damp and the steam; and"
"3750",140,"as old Durham's architects had not built the killing room for the"
"3751",140,"convenience of the hoisters, at every few feet they would have to stoop"
"3752",140,"under a beam, say four feet above the one they ran on; which got them"
"3753",140,"into the habit of stooping, so that in a few years they would be walking"
"3754",140,"like chimpanzees. Worst of any, however, were the fertilizer men, and"
"3755",140,"those who served in the cooking rooms. These people could not be shown"
"3756",140,"to the visitor,--for the odor of a fertilizer man would scare any"
"3757",140,"ordinary visitor at a hundred yards, and as for the other men, who"
"3758",140,"worked in tank rooms full of steam, and in some of which there were open"
"3759",140,"vats near the level of the floor, their peculiar trouble was that they"
"3760",140,"fell into the vats; and when they were fished out, there was never"
"3761",140,"enough of them left to be worth exhibiting,--sometimes they would be"
"3762",140,"overlooked for days, till all but the bones of them had gone out to the"
"3763",140,"world as Durham's Pure Leaf Lard!"

"3770",140,"During the early part of the winter the family had had money enough to"
"3771",140,"live and a little over to pay their debts with; but when the earnings of"
"3772",140,"Jurgis fell from nine or ten dollars a week to five or six, there was"
"3773",140,"no longer anything to spare. The winter went, and the spring came, and"
"3774",140,"found them still living thus from hand to mouth, hanging on day by day,"
"3775",140,"with literally not a month's wages between them and starvation. Marija"
"3776",140,"was in despair, for there was still no word about the reopening of the"
"3777",140,"canning factory, and her savings were almost entirely gone. She had had"
"3778",140,"to give up all idea of marrying then; the family could not get along"
"3779",140,"without her--though for that matter she was likely soon to become a"
"3780",140,"burden even upon them, for when her money was all gone, they would have"
"3781",140,"to pay back what they owed her in board. So Jurgis and Ona and Teta"
"3782",140,"Elzbieta would hold anxious conferences until late at night, trying to"
"3783",140,"figure how they could manage this too without starving."
"3784",140,""
"3785",140,"Such were the cruel terms upon which their life was possible, that they"
"3786",140,"might never have nor expect a single instant's respite from worry, a"
"3787",140,"single instant in which they were not haunted by the thought of money."
"3788",140,"They would no sooner escape, as by a miracle, from one difficulty,"
"3789",140,"than a new one would come into view. In addition to all their physical"
"3790",140,"hardships, there was thus a constant strain upon their minds; they were"
"3791",140,"harried all day and nearly all night by worry and fear. This was in"
"3792",140,"truth not living; it was scarcely even existing, and they felt that it"
"3793",140,"was too little for the price they paid. They were willing to work all"
"3794",140,"the time; and when people did their best, ought they not to be able to"
"3795",140,"keep alive?"
"3796",140,""
"3797",140,"There seemed never to be an end to the things they had to buy and to the"
"3798",140,"unforeseen contingencies. Once their water pipes froze and burst; and"
"3799",140,"when, in their ignorance, they thawed them out, they had a terrifying"
"3800",140,"flood in their house. It happened while the men were away, and poor"
"3801",140,"Elzbieta rushed out into the street screaming for help, for she did"
"3802",140,"not even know whether the flood could be stopped, or whether they were"
"3803",140,"ruined for life. It was nearly as bad as the latter, they found in"
"3804",140,"the end, for the plumber charged them seventy-five cents an hour, and"
"3805",140,"seventy-five cents for another man who had stood and watched him, and"
"3806",140,"included all the time the two had been going and coming, and also a"
"3807",140,"charge for all sorts of material and extras. And then again, when"
"3808",140,"they went to pay their January's installment on the house, the agent"
"3809",140,"terrified them by asking them if they had had the insurance attended"
"3810",140,"to yet. In answer to their inquiry he showed them a clause in the deed"
"3811",140,"which provided that they were to keep the house insured for one thousand"
"3812",140,"dollars, as soon as the present policy ran out, which would happen in"
"3813",140,"a few days. Poor Elzbieta, upon whom again fell the blow, demanded how"
"3814",140,"much it would cost them. Seven dollars, the man said; and that night"
"3815",140,"came Jurgis, grim and determined, requesting that the agent would be"
"3816",140,"good enough to inform him, once for all, as to all the expenses they"
"3817",140,"were liable for. The deed was signed now, he said, with sarcasm proper"
"3818",140,"to the new way of life he had learned--the deed was signed, and so the"
"3819",140,"agent had no longer anything to gain by keeping quiet. And Jurgis looked"
"3820",140,"the fellow squarely in the eye, and so the fellow wasted no time in"
"3821",140,"conventional protests, but read him the deed. They would have to renew"
"3822",140,"the insurance every year; they would have to pay the taxes, about ten"
"3823",140,"dollars a year; they would have to pay the water tax, about six dollars"
"3824",140,"a year--(Jurgis silently resolved to shut off the hydrant). This,"
"3825",140,"besides the interest and the monthly installments, would be all--unless"
"3826",140,"by chance the city should happen to decide to put in a sewer or to lay"
"3827",140,"a sidewalk. Yes, said the agent, they would have to have these, whether"
"3828",140,"they wanted them or not, if the city said so. The sewer would cost them"
"3829",140,"about twenty-two dollars, and the sidewalk fifteen if it were wood,"
"3830",140,"twenty-five if it were cement."
"3831",140,""
"3832",140,"So Jurgis went home again; it was a relief to know the worst, at any"
"3833",140,"rate, so that he could no more be surprised by fresh demands. He saw"
"3834",140,"now how they had been plundered; but they were in for it, there was"
"3835",140,"no turning back. They could only go on and make the fight and win--for"
"3836",140,"defeat was a thing that could not even be thought of."
"3837",140,""
"3838",140,"When the springtime came, they were delivered from the dreadful cold,"
"3839",140,"and that was a great deal; but in addition they had counted on the money"
"3840",140,"they would not have to pay for coal--and it was just at this time that"
"3841",140,"Marija's board began to fail. Then, too, the warm weather brought trials"
"3842",140,"of its own; each season had its trials, as they found. In the spring"
"3843",140,"there were cold rains, that turned the streets into canals and bogs; the"
"3844",140,"mud would be so deep that wagons would sink up to the hubs, so that half"
"3845",140,"a dozen horses could not move them. Then, of course, it was impossible"
"3846",140,"for any one to get to work with dry feet; and this was bad for men that"
"3847",140,"were poorly clad and shod, and still worse for women and children. Later"
"3848",140,"came midsummer, with the stifling heat, when the dingy killing beds of"
"3849",140,"Durham's became a very purgatory; one time, in a single day, three men"
"3850",140,"fell dead from sunstroke. All day long the rivers of hot blood poured"
"3851",140,"forth, until, with the sun beating down, and the air motionless,"
"3852",140,"the stench was enough to knock a man over; all the old smells of a"
"3853",140,"generation would be drawn out by this heat--for there was never any"
"3854",140,"washing of the walls and rafters and pillars, and they were caked with"
"3855",140,"the filth of a lifetime. The men who worked on the killing beds would"
"3856",140,"come to reek with foulness, so that you could smell one of them fifty"
"3857",140,"feet away; there was simply no such thing as keeping decent, the most"
"3858",140,"careful man gave it up in the end, and wallowed in uncleanness. There"
"3859",140,"was not even a place where a man could wash his hands, and the men ate"
"3860",140,"as much raw blood as food at dinnertime. When they were at work they"
"3861",140,"could not even wipe off their faces--they were as helpless as newly born"
"3862",140,"babes in that respect; and it may seem like a small matter, but when the"
"3863",140,"sweat began to run down their necks and tickle them, or a fly to bother"
"3864",140,"them, it was a torture like being burned alive. Whether it was the"
"3865",140,"slaughterhouses or the dumps that were responsible, one could not say,"
"3866",140,"but with the hot weather there descended upon Packingtown a veritable"
"3867",140,"Egyptian plague of flies; there could be no describing this--the houses"
"3868",140,"would be black with them. There was no escaping; you might provide all"
"3869",140,"your doors and windows with screens, but their buzzing outside would be"
"3870",140,"like the swarming of bees, and whenever you opened the door they would"
"3871",140,"rush in as if a storm of wind were driving them."
"3872",140,""
"3873",140,"Perhaps the summertime suggests to you thoughts of the country, visions"
"3874",140,"of green fields and mountains and sparkling lakes. It had no such"
"3875",140,"suggestion for the people in the yards. The great packing machine ground"
"3876",140,"on remorselessly, without thinking of green fields; and the men and"
"3877",140,"women and children who were part of it never saw any green thing, not"
"3878",140,"even a flower. Four or five miles to the east of them lay the blue"
"3879",140,"waters of Lake Michigan; but for all the good it did them it might have"
"3880",140,"been as far away as the Pacific Ocean. They had only Sundays, and"
"3881",140,"then they were too tired to walk. They were tied to the great packing"
"3882",140,"machine, and tied to it for life. The managers and superintendents and"
"3883",140,"clerks of Packingtown were all recruited from another class, and never"
"3884",140,"from the workers; they scorned the workers, the very meanest of them. A"
"3885",140,"poor devil of a bookkeeper who had been working in Durham's for twenty"
"3886",140,"years at a salary of six dollars a week, and might work there for twenty"
"3887",140,"more and do no better, would yet consider himself a gentleman, as far"
"3888",140,"removed as the poles from the most skilled worker on the killing beds;"
"3889",140,"he would dress differently, and live in another part of the town, and"
"3890",140,"come to work at a different hour of the day, and in every way make sure"
"3891",140,"that he never rubbed elbows with a laboring man. Perhaps this was due to"
"3892",140,"the repulsiveness of the work; at any rate, the people who worked with"
"3893",140,"their hands were a class apart, and were made to feel it."
"3894",140,""
"3895",140,"In the late spring the canning factory started up again, and so once"
"3896",140,"more Marija was heard to sing, and the love-music of Tamoszius took on"
"3897",140,"a less melancholy tone. It was not for long, however; for a month or two"
"3898",140,"later a dreadful calamity fell upon Marija. Just one year and three days"
"3899",140,"after she had begun work as a can-painter, she lost her job."
"3900",140,""
"3901",140,"It was a long story. Marija insisted that it was because of her activity"
"3902",140,"in the union. The packers, of course, had spies in all the unions, and"
"3903",140,"in addition they made a practice of buying up a certain number of the"
"3904",140,"union officials, as many as they thought they needed. So every week they"
"3905",140,"received reports as to what was going on, and often they knew things"
"3906",140,"before the members of the union knew them. Any one who was considered"
"3907",140,"to be dangerous by them would find that he was not a favorite with"
"3908",140,"his boss; and Marija had been a great hand for going after the foreign"
"3909",140,"people and preaching to them. However that might be, the known facts"
"3910",140,"were that a few weeks before the factory closed, Marija had been cheated"
"3911",140,"out of her pay for three hundred cans. The girls worked at a long table,"
"3912",140,"and behind them walked a woman with pencil and notebook, keeping count"
"3913",140,"of the number they finished. This woman was, of course, only human, and"
"3914",140,"sometimes made mistakes; when this happened, there was no redress--if"
"3915",140,"on Saturday you got less money than you had earned, you had to make the"
"3916",140,"best of it. But Marija did not understand this, and made a disturbance."
"3917",140,"Marija's disturbances did not mean anything, and while she had known"
"3918",140,"only Lithuanian and Polish, they had done no harm, for people only"
"3919",140,"laughed at her and made her cry. But now Marija was able to call names"
"3920",140,"in English, and so she got the woman who made the mistake to disliking"
"3921",140,"her. Probably, as Marija claimed, she made mistakes on purpose after"
"3922",140,"that; at any rate, she made them, and the third time it happened Marija"
"3923",140,"went on the warpath and took the matter first to the forelady, and"
"3924",140,"when she got no satisfaction there, to the superintendent. This was"
"3925",140,"unheard-of presumption, but the superintendent said he would see about"
"3926",140,"it, which Marija took to mean that she was going to get her money; after"
"3927",140,"waiting three days, she went to see the superintendent again. This time"
"3928",140,"the man frowned, and said that he had not had time to attend to it; and"
"3929",140,"when Marija, against the advice and warning of every one, tried it once"
"3930",140,"more, he ordered her back to her work in a passion. Just how things"
"3931",140,"happened after that Marija was not sure, but that afternoon the forelady"
"3932",140,"told her that her services would not be any longer required. Poor Marija"
"3933",140,"could not have been more dumfounded had the woman knocked her over the"
"3934",140,"head; at first she could not believe what she heard, and then she grew"
"3935",140,"furious and swore that she would come anyway, that her place belonged"
"3936",140,"to her. In the end she sat down in the middle of the floor and wept and"
"3937",140,"wailed."
"3938",140,""
"3939",140,"It was a cruel lesson; but then Marija was headstrong--she should have"
"3940",140,"listened to those who had had experience. The next time she would know"
"3941",140,"her place, as the forelady expressed it; and so Marija went out, and the"
"3942",140,"family faced the problem of an existence again."
"3943",140,""
"3944",140,"It was especially hard this time, for Ona was to be confined before"
"3945",140,"long, and Jurgis was trying hard to save up money for this. He had"
"3946",140,"heard dreadful stories of the midwives, who grow as thick as fleas"
"3947",140,"in Packingtown; and he had made up his mind that Ona must have a"
"3948",140,"man-doctor. Jurgis could be very obstinate when he wanted to, and he"
"3949",140,"was in this case, much to the dismay of the women, who felt that a"
"3950",140,"man-doctor was an impropriety, and that the matter really belonged to"
"3951",140,"them. The cheapest doctor they could find would charge them fifteen"
"3952",140,"dollars, and perhaps more when the bill came in; and here was Jurgis,"
"3953",140,"declaring that he would pay it, even if he had to stop eating in the"
"3954",140,"meantime!"
"3955",140,""
"3956",140,"Marija had only about twenty-five dollars left. Day after day she"
"3957",140,"wandered about the yards begging a job, but this time without hope of"
"3958",140,"finding it. Marija could do the work of an able-bodied man, when she"
"3959",140,"was cheerful, but discouragement wore her out easily, and she would come"
"3960",140,"home at night a pitiable object. She learned her lesson this time, poor"
"3961",140,"creature; she learned it ten times over. All the family learned it along"
"3962",140,"with her--that when you have once got a job in Packingtown, you hang on"
"3963",140,"to it, come what will."
"3964",140,""
"3965",140,"Four weeks Marija hunted, and half of a fifth week. Of course she"
"3966",140,"stopped paying her dues to the union. She lost all interest in the"
"3967",140,"union, and cursed herself for a fool that she had ever been dragged"
"3968",140,"into one. She had about made up her mind that she was a lost soul,"
"3969",140,"when somebody told her of an opening, and she went and got a place as"
"3970",140,"a ""beef-trimmer."" She got this because the boss saw that she had the"
"3971",140,"muscles of a man, and so he discharged a man and put Marija to do his"
"3972",140,"work, paying her a little more than half what he had been paying before."
"3973",140,""
"3974",140,"When she first came to Packingtown, Marija would have scorned such work"
"3975",140,"as this. She was in another canning factory, and her work was to trim"
"3976",140,"the meat of those diseased cattle that Jurgis had been told about not"
"3977",140,"long before. She was shut up in one of the rooms where the people seldom"
"3978",140,"saw the daylight; beneath her were the chilling rooms, where the meat"
"3979",140,"was frozen, and above her were the cooking rooms; and so she stood on an"
"3980",140,"ice-cold floor, while her head was often so hot that she could scarcely"
"3981",140,"breathe. Trimming beef off the bones by the hundred-weight, while"
"3982",140,"standing up from early morning till late at night, with heavy boots on"
"3983",140,"and the floor always damp and full of puddles, liable to be thrown out"
"3984",140,"of work indefinitely because of a slackening in the trade, liable again"
"3985",140,"to be kept overtime in rush seasons, and be worked till she trembled"
"3986",140,"in every nerve and lost her grip on her slimy knife, and gave herself"
"3987",140,"a poisoned wound--that was the new life that unfolded itself before"
"3988",140,"Marija. But because Marija was a human horse she merely laughed and went"
"3989",140,"at it; it would enable her to pay her board again, and keep the family"
"3990",140,"going. And as for Tamoszius--well, they had waited a long time, and they"
"3991",140,"could wait a little longer. They could not possibly get along upon his"
"3992",140,"wages alone, and the family could not live without hers. He could come"
"3993",140,"and visit her, and sit in the kitchen and hold her hand, and he must"
"3994",140,"manage to be content with that. But day by day the music of Tamoszius'"
"3995",140,"violin became more passionate and heartbreaking; and Marija would sit"
"3996",140,"with her hands clasped and her cheeks wet and all her body a-tremble,"
"3997",140,"hearing in the wailing melodies the voices of the unborn generations"
"3998",140,"which cried out in her for life."
"3999",140,""
"4000",140,""
"4001",140,"Marija's lesson came just in time to save Ona from a similar fate."
"4002",140,"Ona, too, was dissatisfied with her place, and had far more reason than"
"4003",140,"Marija. She did not tell half of her story at home, because she saw it"
"4004",140,"was a torment to Jurgis, and she was afraid of what he might do. For"
"4005",140,"a long time Ona had seen that Miss Henderson, the forelady in her"
"4006",140,"department, did not like her. At first she thought it was the old-time"
"4007",140,"mistake she had made in asking for a holiday to get married. Then she"
"4008",140,"concluded it must be because she did not give the forelady a present"
"4009",140,"occasionally--she was the kind that took presents from the girls, Ona"
"4010",140,"learned, and made all sorts of discriminations in favor of those who"
"4011",140,"gave them. In the end, however, Ona discovered that it was even worse"
"4012",140,"than that. Miss Henderson was a newcomer, and it was some time before"
"4013",140,"rumor made her out; but finally it transpired that she was a kept woman,"
"4014",140,"the former mistress of the superintendent of a department in the same"
"4015",140,"building. He had put her there to keep her quiet, it seemed--and that"
"4016",140,"not altogether with success, for once or twice they had been heard"
"4017",140,"quarreling. She had the temper of a hyena, and soon the place she ran"
"4018",140,"was a witch's caldron. There were some of the girls who were of her own"
"4019",140,"sort, who were willing to toady to her and flatter her; and these would"
"4020",140,"carry tales about the rest, and so the furies were unchained in the"
"4021",140,"place. Worse than this, the woman lived in a bawdy-house downtown, with"
"4022",140,"a coarse, red-faced Irishman named Connor, who was the boss of the"
"4023",140,"loading-gang outside, and would make free with the girls as they went"
"4024",140,"to and from their work. In the slack seasons some of them would go with"
"4025",140,"Miss Henderson to this house downtown--in fact, it would not be too much"
"4026",140,"to say that she managed her department at Brown's in conjunction with"
"4027",140,"it. Sometimes women from the house would be given places alongside of"
"4028",140,"decent girls, and after other decent girls had been turned off to make"
"4029",140,"room for them. When you worked in this woman's department the house"
"4030",140,"downtown was never out of your thoughts all day--there were always"
"4031",140,"whiffs of it to be caught, like the odor of the Packingtown rendering"
"4032",140,"plants at night, when the wind shifted suddenly. There would be stories"
"4033",140,"about it going the rounds; the girls opposite you would be telling them"
"4034",140,"and winking at you. In such a place Ona would not have stayed a day, but"
"4035",140,"for starvation; and, as it was, she was never sure that she could"
"4036",140,"stay the next day. She understood now that the real reason that Miss"
"4037",140,"Henderson hated her was that she was a decent married girl; and she knew"
"4038",140,"that the talebearers and the toadies hated her for the same reason, and"
"4039",140,"were doing their best to make her life miserable."
"4040",140,""
"4041",140,"But there was no place a girl could go in Packingtown, if she was"
"4042",140,"particular about things of this sort; there was no place in it where"
"4043",140,"a prostitute could not get along better than a decent girl. Here was a"
"4044",140,"population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of"
"4045",140,"starvation, and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of"
"4046",140,"men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers;"
"4047",140,"under such circumstances immorality was exactly as inevitable, and as"
"4048",140,"prevalent, as it was under the system of chattel slavery. Things that"
"4049",140,"were quite unspeakable went on there in the packing houses all the time,"
"4050",140,"and were taken for granted by everybody; only they did not show, as in"
"4051",140,"the old slavery times, because there was no difference in color between"
"4052",140,"master and slave."
"4053",140,""
"4054",140,""
"4055",140,"One morning Ona stayed home, and Jurgis had the man-doctor, according"
"4056",140,"to his whim, and she was safely delivered of a fine baby. It was an"
"4057",140,"enormous big boy, and Ona was such a tiny creature herself, that it"
"4058",140,"seemed quite incredible. Jurgis would stand and gaze at the stranger by"
"4059",140,"the hour, unable to believe that it had really happened."
"4060",140,""
"4061",140,"The coming of this boy was a decisive event with Jurgis. It made him"
"4062",140,"irrevocably a family man; it killed the last lingering impulse that he"
"4063",140,"might have had to go out in the evenings and sit and talk with the men"
"4064",140,"in the saloons. There was nothing he cared for now so much as to sit"
"4065",140,"and look at the baby. This was very curious, for Jurgis had never been"
"4066",140,"interested in babies before. But then, this was a very unusual sort of a"
"4067",140,"baby. He had the brightest little black eyes, and little black ringlets"
"4068",140,"all over his head; he was the living image of his father, everybody"
"4069",140,"said--and Jurgis found this a fascinating circumstance. It was"
"4070",140,"sufficiently perplexing that this tiny mite of life should have come"
"4071",140,"into the world at all in the manner that it had; that it should have"
"4072",140,"come with a comical imitation of its father's nose was simply uncanny."
"4073",140,""
"4074",140,"Perhaps, Jurgis thought, this was intended to signify that it was his"
"4075",140,"baby; that it was his and Ona's, to care for all its life. Jurgis had"
"4076",140,"never possessed anything nearly so interesting--a baby was, when you"
"4077",140,"came to think about it, assuredly a marvelous possession. It would grow"
"4078",140,"up to be a man, a human soul, with a personality all its own, a will of"
"4079",140,"its own! Such thoughts would keep haunting Jurgis, filling him with"
"4080",140,"all sorts of strange and almost painful excitements. He was wonderfully"
"4081",140,"proud of little Antanas; he was curious about all the details of"
"4082",140,"him--the washing and the dressing and the eating and the sleeping of"
"4083",140,"him, and asked all sorts of absurd questions. It took him quite a"
"4084",140,"while to get over his alarm at the incredible shortness of the little"
"4085",140,"creature's legs."
"4086",140,""
"4087",140,"Jurgis had, alas, very little time to see his baby; he never felt the"
"4088",140,"chains about him more than just then. When he came home at night, the"
"4089",140,"baby would be asleep, and it would be the merest chance if he awoke"
"4090",140,"before Jurgis had to go to sleep himself. Then in the morning there was"
"4091",140,"no time to look at him, so really the only chance the father had was on"
"4092",140,"Sundays. This was more cruel yet for Ona, who ought to have stayed"
"4093",140,"home and nursed him, the doctor said, for her own health as well as the"
"4094",140,"baby's; but Ona had to go to work, and leave him for Teta Elzbieta"
"4095",140,"to feed upon the pale blue poison that was called milk at the corner"
"4096",140,"grocery. Ona's confinement lost her only a week's wages--she would go to"
"4097",140,"the factory the second Monday, and the best that Jurgis could persuade"
"4098",140,"her was to ride in the car, and let him run along behind and help her to"
"4099",140,"Brown's when she alighted. After that it would be all right, said Ona,"
"4100",140,"it was no strain sitting still sewing hams all day; and if she waited"
"4101",140,"longer she might find that her dreadful forelady had put some one"
"4102",140,"else in her place. That would be a greater calamity than ever now, Ona"
"4103",140,"continued, on account of the baby. They would all have to work harder"
"4104",140,"now on his account. It was such a responsibility--they must not have the"
"4105",140,"baby grow up to suffer as they had. And this indeed had been the first"
"4106",140,"thing that Jurgis had thought of himself--he had clenched his hands and"
"4107",140,"braced himself anew for the struggle, for the sake of that tiny mite of"
"4108",140,"human possibility."
"4109",140,""
"4110",140,"And so Ona went back to Brown's and saved her place and a week's wages;"
"4111",140,"and so she gave herself some one of the thousand ailments that women"
"4112",140,"group under the title of ""womb trouble,"" and was never again a well"
"4113",140,"person as long as she lived. It is difficult to convey in words all that"
"4114",140,"this meant to Ona; it seemed such a slight offense, and the punishment"
"4115",140,"was so out of all proportion, that neither she nor any one else ever"
"4116",140,"connected the two. ""Womb trouble"" to Ona did not mean a specialist's"
"4117",140,"diagnosis, and a course of treatment, and perhaps an operation or two;"
"4118",140,"it meant simply headaches and pains in the back, and depression and"
"4119",140,"heartsickness, and neuralgia when she had to go to work in the rain. The"
"4120",140,"great majority of the women who worked in Packingtown suffered in the"
"4121",140,"same way, and from the same cause, so it was not deemed a thing to see"
"4122",140,"the doctor about; instead Ona would try patent medicines, one after"
"4123",140,"another, as her friends told her about them. As these all contained"
"4124",140,"alcohol, or some other stimulant, she found that they all did her good"
"4125",140,"while she took them; and so she was always chasing the phantom of good"
"4126",140,"health, and losing it because she was too poor to continue."

"4133",140,"During the summer the packing houses were in full activity again, and"
"4134",140,"Jurgis made more money. He did not make so much, however, as he had the"
"4135",140,"previous summer, for the packers took on more hands. There were new men"
"4136",140,"every week, it seemed--it was a regular system; and this number they"
"4137",140,"would keep over to the next slack season, so that every one would have"
"4138",140,"less than ever. Sooner or later, by this plan, they would have all the"
"4139",140,"floating labor of Chicago trained to do their work. And how very cunning"
"4140",140,"a trick was that! The men were to teach new hands, who would some day"
"4141",140,"come and break their strike; and meantime they were kept so poor that"
"4142",140,"they could not prepare for the trial!"
"4143",140,""

"4145",140,"work for any one! On the contrary, the speeding-up seemed to be growing"
"4146",140,"more savage all the time; they were continually inventing new devices to"
"4147",140,"crowd the work on--it was for all the world like the thumbscrew of the"
"4148",140,"medieval torture chamber. They would get new pacemakers and pay them"
"4149",140,"more; they would drive the men on with new machinery--it was said"
"4150",140,"that in the hog-killing rooms the speed at which the hogs moved was"
"4151",140,"determined by clockwork, and that it was increased a little every day."
"4152",140,"In piecework they would reduce the time, requiring the same work in a"
"4153",140,"shorter time, and paying the same wages; and then, after the workers had"
"4154",140,"accustomed themselves to this new speed, they would reduce the rate of"
"4155",140,"payment to correspond with the reduction in time! They had done this"
"4156",140,"so often in the canning establishments that the girls were fairly"
"4157",140,"desperate; their wages had gone down by a full third in the past two"
"4158",140,"years, and a storm of discontent was brewing that was likely to break"
"4159",140,"any day. Only a month after Marija had become a beef-trimmer the canning"
"4160",140,"factory that she had left posted a cut that would divide the girls'"
"4161",140,"earnings almost squarely in half; and so great was the indignation at"
"4162",140,"this that they marched out without even a parley, and organized in the"
"4163",140,"street outside. One of the girls had read somewhere that a red flag was"
"4164",140,"the proper symbol for oppressed workers, and so they mounted one, and"
"4165",140,"paraded all about the yards, yelling with rage. A new union was the"
"4166",140,"result of this outburst, but the impromptu strike went to pieces in"
"4167",140,"three days, owing to the rush of new labor. At the end of it the girl"
"4168",140,"who had carried the red flag went downtown and got a position in a great"
"4169",140,"department store, at a salary of two dollars and a half a week."
"4170",140,""
"4171",140,"Jurgis and Ona heard these stories with dismay, for there was no telling"
"4172",140,"when their own time might come. Once or twice there had been rumors"
"4173",140,"that one of the big houses was going to cut its unskilled men to fifteen"
"4174",140,"cents an hour, and Jurgis knew that if this was done, his turn would"
"4175",140,"come soon. He had learned by this time that Packingtown was really not"
"4176",140,"a number of firms at all, but one great firm, the Beef Trust. And every"
"4177",140,"week the managers of it got together and compared notes, and there"
"4178",140,"was one scale for all the workers in the yards and one standard of"
"4179",140,"efficiency. Jurgis was told that they also fixed the price they would"
"4180",140,"pay for beef on the hoof and the price of all dressed meat in the"
"4181",140,"country; but that was something he did not understand or care about."

"4186",140,"beef-trimmer, and was mounting to the heights again. During the summer"
"4187",140,"and fall Jurgis and Ona managed to pay her back the last penny they"
"4188",140,"owed her, and so she began to have a bank account. Tamoszius had a bank"
"4189",140,"account also, and they ran a race, and began to figure upon household"

"4191",140,""
"4192",140,"The possession of vast wealth entails cares and responsibilities,"
"4193",140,"however, as poor Marija found out. She had taken the advice of a friend"
"4194",140,"and invested her savings in a bank on Ashland Avenue. Of course she knew"
"4195",140,"nothing about it, except that it was big and imposing--what possible"

"4197",140,"business, as it is conducted in this land of frenzied finance? So Marija"

"4199",140,"would go out of her way mornings to make sure that it was still there."
"4200",140,"Her principal thought was of fire, for she had deposited her money in"
"4201",140,"bills, and was afraid that if they were burned up the bank would not"
"4202",140,"give her any others. Jurgis made fun of her for this, for he was a man"
"4203",140,"and was proud of his superior knowledge, telling her that the bank had"

"4210",140,"terror. She broke into a run, shouting to the people to ask what was the"
"4211",140,"matter, but not stopping to hear what they answered, till she had come"
"4212",140,"to where the throng was so dense that she could no longer advance. There"
"4213",140,"was a ""run on the bank,"" they told her then, but she did not know what"
"4214",140,"that was, and turned from one person to another, trying in an agony"
"4215",140,"of fear to make out what they meant. Had something gone wrong with the"
"4216",140,"bank? Nobody was sure, but they thought so. Couldn't she get her money?"
"4217",140,"There was no telling; the people were afraid not, and they were all"
"4218",140,"trying to get it. It was too early yet to tell anything--the bank would"
"4219",140,"not open for nearly three hours. So in a frenzy of despair Marija began"
"4220",140,"to claw her way toward the doors of this building, through a throng of"
"4221",140,"men, women, and children, all as excited as herself. It was a scene of"
"4222",140,"wild confusion, women shrieking and wringing their hands and fainting,"
"4223",140,"and men fighting and trampling down everything in their way. In"
"4224",140,"the midst of the melee Marija recollected that she did not have her"

"4228",140,""
"4229",140,"In half an hour Marija was back, Teta Elzbieta with her, both of them"

"4231",140,"in a line, extending for several blocks, with half a hundred policemen"
"4232",140,"keeping guard, and so there was nothing for them to do but to take their"
"4233",140,"places at the end of it. At nine o'clock the bank opened and began to"
"4234",140,"pay the waiting throng; but then, what good did that do Marija, who saw"
"4235",140,"three thousand people before her--enough to take out the last penny of a"
"4236",140,"dozen banks?"
"4237",140,""
"4238",140,"To make matters worse a drizzling rain came up, and soaked them to the"
"4239",140,"skin; yet all the morning they stood there, creeping slowly toward the"
"4240",140,"goal--all the afternoon they stood there, heartsick, seeing that the"
"4241",140,"hour of closing was coming, and that they were going to be left out."
"4242",140,"Marija made up her mind that, come what might, she would stay there and"
"4243",140,"keep her place; but as nearly all did the same, all through the long,"
"4244",140,"cold night, she got very little closer to the bank for that. Toward"
"4245",140,"evening Jurgis came; he had heard the story from the children, and he"
"4246",140,"brought some food and dry wraps, which made it a little easier."
"4247",140,""
"4248",140,"The next morning, before daybreak, came a bigger crowd than ever, and"
"4249",140,"more policemen from downtown. Marija held on like grim death, and toward"
"4250",140,"afternoon she got into the bank and got her money--all in big silver"
"4251",140,"dollars, a handkerchief full. When she had once got her hands on them"
"4252",140,"her fear vanished, and she wanted to put them back again; but the man"
"4253",140,"at the window was savage, and said that the bank would receive no more"
"4254",140,"deposits from those who had taken part in the run. So Marija was forced"
"4255",140,"to take her dollars home with her, watching to right and left, expecting"
"4256",140,"every instant that some one would try to rob her; and when she got home"
"4257",140,"she was not much better off. Until she could find another bank there was"
"4258",140,"nothing to do but sew them up in her clothes, and so Marija went about"
"4259",140,"for a week or more, loaded down with bullion, and afraid to cross the"
"4260",140,"street in front of the house, because Jurgis told her she would sink out"
"4261",140,"of sight in the mud. Weighted this way she made her way to the"
"4262",140,"yards, again in fear, this time to see if she had lost her place; but"
"4263",140,"fortunately about ten per cent of the working people of Packingtown had"
"4264",140,"been depositors in that bank, and it was not convenient to discharge"
"4265",140,"that many at once. The cause of the panic had been the attempt of a"
"4266",140,"policeman to arrest a drunken man in a saloon next door, which had drawn"
"4267",140,"a crowd at the hour the people were on their way to work, and so started"
"4268",140,"the ""run."""
"4269",140,""
"4270",140,"About this time Jurgis and Ona also began a bank account. Besides having"
"4271",140,"paid Jonas and Marija, they had almost paid for their furniture, and"
"4272",140,"could have that little sum to count on. So long as each of them could"
"4273",140,"bring home nine or ten dollars a week, they were able to get along"
"4274",140,"finely. Also election day came round again, and Jurgis made half a"
"4275",140,"week's wages out of that, all net profit. It was a very close election"
"4276",140,"that year, and the echoes of the battle reached even to Packingtown. The"
"4277",140,"two rival sets of grafters hired halls and set off fireworks and made"
"4278",140,"speeches, to try to get the people interested in the matter. Although"
"4279",140,"Jurgis did not understand it all, he knew enough by this time to realize"
"4280",140,"that it was not supposed to be right to sell your vote. However, as"
"4281",140,"every one did it, and his refusal to join would not have made the"
"4282",140,"slightest difference in the results, the idea of refusing would have"
"4283",140,"seemed absurd, had it ever come into his head."
"4284",140,""
"4285",140,""
"4286",140,"Now chill winds and shortening days began to warn them that the winter"
"4287",140,"was coming again. It seemed as if the respite had been too short--they"
"4288",140,"had not had time enough to get ready for it; but still it came,"
"4289",140,"inexorably, and the hunted look began to come back into the eyes of"
"4290",140,"little Stanislovas. The prospect struck fear to the heart of Jurgis"
"4291",140,"also, for he knew that Ona was not fit to face the cold and the"
"4292",140,"snowdrifts this year. And suppose that some day when a blizzard struck"
"4293",140,"them and the cars were not running, Ona should have to give up, and"
"4294",140,"should come the next day to find that her place had been given to some"
"4295",140,"one who lived nearer and could be depended on?"
"4296",140,""
"4297",140,"It was the week before Christmas that the first storm came, and then the"
"4298",140,"soul of Jurgis rose up within him like a sleeping lion. There were four"
"4299",140,"days that the Ashland Avenue cars were stalled, and in those days,"
"4300",140,"for the first time in his life, Jurgis knew what it was to be really"
"4301",140,"opposed. He had faced difficulties before, but they had been child's"
"4302",140,"play; now there was a death struggle, and all the furies were unchained"
"4303",140,"within him. The first morning they set out two hours before dawn, Ona"
"4304",140,"wrapped all in blankets and tossed upon his shoulder like a sack of"
"4305",140,"meal, and the little boy, bundled nearly out of sight, hanging by"
"4306",140,"his coat-tails. There was a raging blast beating in his face, and the"
"4307",140,"thermometer stood below zero; the snow was never short of his knees, and"
"4308",140,"in some of the drifts it was nearly up to his armpits. It would catch"
"4309",140,"his feet and try to trip him; it would build itself into a wall before"
"4310",140,"him to beat him back; and he would fling himself into it, plunging like"
"4311",140,"a wounded buffalo, puffing and snorting in rage. So foot by foot he"
"4312",140,"drove his way, and when at last he came to Durham's he was staggering"
"4313",140,"and almost blind, and leaned against a pillar, gasping, and thanking God"
"4314",140,"that the cattle came late to the killing beds that day. In the evening"
"4315",140,"the same thing had to be done again; and because Jurgis could not tell"
"4316",140,"what hour of the night he would get off, he got a saloon-keeper to let"
"4317",140,"Ona sit and wait for him in a corner. Once it was eleven o'clock at"
"4318",140,"night, and black as the pit, but still they got home."
"4319",140,""
"4320",140,"That blizzard knocked many a man out, for the crowd outside begging for"
"4321",140,"work was never greater, and the packers would not wait long for any"
"4322",140,"one. When it was over, the soul of Jurgis was a song, for he had met"
"4323",140,"the enemy and conquered, and felt himself the master of his fate.--So it"
"4324",140,"might be with some monarch of the forest that has vanquished his foes in"
"4325",140,"fair fight, and then falls into some cowardly trap in the night-time."
"4326",140,""
"4327",140,"A time of peril on the killing beds was when a steer broke loose."
"4328",140,"Sometimes, in the haste of speeding-up, they would dump one of the"
"4329",140,"animals out on the floor before it was fully stunned, and it would get"
"4330",140,"upon its feet and run amuck. Then there would be a yell of warning--the"
"4331",140,"men would drop everything and dash for the nearest pillar, slipping"
"4332",140,"here and there on the floor, and tumbling over each other. This was bad"
"4333",140,"enough in the summer, when a man could see; in wintertime it was enough"
"4334",140,"to make your hair stand up, for the room would be so full of steam that"
"4335",140,"you could not make anything out five feet in front of you. To be sure,"
"4336",140,"the steer was generally blind and frantic, and not especially bent on"
"4337",140,"hurting any one; but think of the chances of running upon a knife, while"
"4338",140,"nearly every man had one in his hand! And then, to cap the climax, the"
"4339",140,"floor boss would come rushing up with a rifle and begin blazing away!"
"4340",140,""
"4341",140,"It was in one of these melees that Jurgis fell into his trap. That is"
"4342",140,"the only word to describe it; it was so cruel, and so utterly not to"
"4343",140,"be foreseen. At first he hardly noticed it, it was such a slight"
"4344",140,"accident--simply that in leaping out of the way he turned his ankle."
"4345",140,"There was a twinge of pain, but Jurgis was used to pain, and did not"
"4346",140,"coddle himself. When he came to walk home, however, he realized that it"
"4347",140,"was hurting him a great deal; and in the morning his ankle was swollen"
"4348",140,"out nearly double its size, and he could not get his foot into his shoe."
"4349",140,"Still, even then, he did nothing more than swear a little, and wrapped"
"4350",140,"his foot in old rags, and hobbled out to take the car. It chanced to be"
"4351",140,"a rush day at Durham's, and all the long morning he limped about with"
"4352",140,"his aching foot; by noontime the pain was so great that it made him"
"4353",140,"faint, and after a couple of hours in the afternoon he was fairly"
"4354",140,"beaten, and had to tell the boss. They sent for the company doctor, and"
"4355",140,"he examined the foot and told Jurgis to go home to bed, adding that he"
"4356",140,"had probably laid himself up for months by his folly. The injury was not"
"4357",140,"one that Durham and Company could be held responsible for, and so that"
"4358",140,"was all there was to it, so far as the doctor was concerned."
"4359",140,""
"4360",140,"Jurgis got home somehow, scarcely able to see for the pain, and with an"
"4361",140,"awful terror in his soul, Elzbieta helped him into bed and bandaged"
"4362",140,"his injured foot with cold water and tried hard not to let him see her"
"4363",140,"dismay; when the rest came home at night she met them outside and told"
"4364",140,"them, and they, too, put on a cheerful face, saying it would only be for"
"4365",140,"a week or two, and that they would pull him through."
"4366",140,""
"4367",140,"When they had gotten him to sleep, however, they sat by the kitchen fire"
"4368",140,"and talked it over in frightened whispers. They were in for a siege,"
"4369",140,"that was plainly to be seen. Jurgis had only about sixty dollars in the"
"4370",140,"bank, and the slack season was upon them. Both Jonas and Marija might"
"4371",140,"soon be earning no more than enough to pay their board, and besides that"
"4372",140,"there were only the wages of Ona and the pittance of the little boy."
"4373",140,"There was the rent to pay, and still some on the furniture; there was"
"4374",140,"the insurance just due, and every month there was sack after sack"
"4375",140,"of coal. It was January, midwinter, an awful time to have to face"
"4376",140,"privation. Deep snows would come again, and who would carry Ona to her"
"4377",140,"work now? She might lose her place--she was almost certain to lose it."
"4378",140,"And then little Stanislovas began to whimper--who would take care of"
"4379",140,"him?"
"4380",140,""
"4381",140,"It was dreadful that an accident of this sort, that no man can help,"
"4382",140,"should have meant such suffering. The bitterness of it was the daily"
"4383",140,"food and drink of Jurgis. It was of no use for them to try to deceive"
"4384",140,"him; he knew as much about the situation as they did, and he knew that"
"4385",140,"the family might literally starve to death. The worry of it fairly ate"
"4386",140,"him up--he began to look haggard the first two or three days of it. In"
"4387",140,"truth, it was almost maddening for a strong man like him, a fighter, to"
"4388",140,"have to lie there helpless on his back. It was for all the world the"
"4389",140,"old story of Prometheus bound. As Jurgis lay on his bed, hour after hour"
"4390",140,"there came to him emotions that he had never known before. Before this"
"4391",140,"he had met life with a welcome--it had its trials, but none that a man"
"4392",140,"could not face. But now, in the nighttime, when he lay tossing about,"
"4393",140,"there would come stalking into his chamber a grisly phantom, the sight"
"4394",140,"of which made his flesh curl and his hair to bristle up. It was like"
"4395",140,"seeing the world fall away from underneath his feet; like plunging down"
"4396",140,"into a bottomless abyss into yawning caverns of despair. It might be"
"4397",140,"true, then, after all, what others had told him about life, that the"
"4398",140,"best powers of a man might not be equal to it! It might be true that,"
"4399",140,"strive as he would, toil as he would, he might fail, and go down and be"
"4400",140,"destroyed! The thought of this was like an icy hand at his heart; the"
"4401",140,"thought that here, in this ghastly home of all horror, he and all those"
"4402",140,"who were dear to him might lie and perish of starvation and cold, and"
"4403",140,"there would be no ear to hear their cry, no hand to help them! It was"
"4404",140,"true, it was true,--that here in this huge city, with its stores of"
"4405",140,"heaped-up wealth, human creatures might be hunted down and destroyed by"
"4406",140,"the wild-beast powers of nature, just as truly as ever they were in the"
"4407",140,"days of the cave men!"
"4408",140,""
"4409",140,"Ona was now making about thirty dollars a month, and Stanislovas about"
"4410",140,"thirteen. To add to this there was the board of Jonas and Marija,"
"4411",140,"about forty-five dollars. Deducting from this the rent, interest,"
"4412",140,"and installments on the furniture, they had left sixty dollars, and"
"4413",140,"deducting the coal, they had fifty. They did without everything that"
"4414",140,"human beings could do without; they went in old and ragged clothing,"
"4415",140,"that left them at the mercy of the cold, and when the children's shoes"
"4416",140,"wore out, they tied them up with string. Half invalid as she was, Ona"
"4417",140,"would do herself harm by walking in the rain and cold when she ought"
"4418",140,"to have ridden; they bought literally nothing but food--and still they"
"4419",140,"could not keep alive on fifty dollars a month. They might have done it,"
"4420",140,"if only they could have gotten pure food, and at fair prices; or if only"
"4421",140,"they had known what to get--if they had not been so pitifully ignorant!"
"4422",140,"But they had come to a new country, where everything was different,"
"4423",140,"including the food. They had always been accustomed to eat a great deal"
"4424",140,"of smoked sausage, and how could they know that what they bought in"
"4425",140,"America was not the same--that its color was made by chemicals, and its"
"4426",140,"smoky flavor by more chemicals, and that it was full of ""potato flour"""
"4427",140,"besides? Potato flour is the waste of potato after the starch and"
"4428",140,"alcohol have been extracted; it has no more food value than so much"
"4429",140,"wood, and as its use as a food adulterant is a penal offense in Europe,"
"4430",140,"thousands of tons of it are shipped to America every year. It was"
"4431",140,"amazing what quantities of food such as this were needed every day, by"
"4432",140,"eleven hungry persons. A dollar sixty-five a day was simply not enough"
"4433",140,"to feed them, and there was no use trying; and so each week they made an"
"4434",140,"inroad upon the pitiful little bank account that Ona had begun. Because"
"4435",140,"the account was in her name, it was possible for her to keep this a"
"4436",140,"secret from her husband, and to keep the heartsickness of it for her"
"4437",140,"own."
"4438",140,""
"4439",140,"It would have been better if Jurgis had been really ill; if he had not"
"4440",140,"been able to think. For he had no resources such as most invalids have;"
"4441",140,"all he could do was to lie there and toss about from side to side. Now"
"4442",140,"and then he would break into cursing, regardless of everything; and now"
"4443",140,"and then his impatience would get the better of him, and he would try to"
"4444",140,"get up, and poor Teta Elzbieta would have to plead with him in a frenzy."
"4445",140,"Elzbieta was all alone with him the greater part of the time. She would"
"4446",140,"sit and smooth his forehead by the hour, and talk to him and try to make"
"4447",140,"him forget. Sometimes it would be too cold for the children to go to"
"4448",140,"school, and they would have to play in the kitchen, where Jurgis was,"
"4449",140,"because it was the only room that was half warm. These were dreadful"
"4450",140,"times, for Jurgis would get as cross as any bear; he was scarcely to"
"4451",140,"be blamed, for he had enough to worry him, and it was hard when he was"
"4452",140,"trying to take a nap to be kept awake by noisy and peevish children."
"4453",140,""
"4454",140,"Elzbieta's only resource in those times was little Antanas; indeed, it"
"4455",140,"would be hard to say how they could have gotten along at all if it had"
"4456",140,"not been for little Antanas. It was the one consolation of Jurgis' long"
"4457",140,"imprisonment that now he had time to look at his baby. Teta Elzbieta"
"4458",140,"would put the clothes-basket in which the baby slept alongside of his"
"4459",140,"mattress, and Jurgis would lie upon one elbow and watch him by the"
"4460",140,"hour, imagining things. Then little Antanas would open his eyes--he was"
"4461",140,"beginning to take notice of things now; and he would smile--how he would"
"4462",140,"smile! So Jurgis would begin to forget and be happy because he was in"
"4463",140,"a world where there was a thing so beautiful as the smile of little"
"4464",140,"Antanas, and because such a world could not but be good at the heart of"
"4465",140,"it. He looked more like his father every hour, Elzbieta would say, and"
"4466",140,"said it many times a day, because she saw that it pleased Jurgis; the"
"4467",140,"poor little terror-stricken woman was planning all day and all night"
"4468",140,"to soothe the prisoned giant who was intrusted to her care. Jurgis, who"
"4469",140,"knew nothing about the age-long and everlasting hypocrisy of woman, would"
"4470",140,"take the bait and grin with delight; and then he would hold his finger"
"4471",140,"in front of little Antanas' eyes, and move it this way and that, and"
"4472",140,"laugh with glee to see the baby follow it. There is no pet quite so"
"4473",140,"fascinating as a baby; he would look into Jurgis' face with such uncanny"
"4474",140,"seriousness, and Jurgis would start and cry: ""Palauk! Look, Muma, he"
"4475",140,"knows his papa! He does, he does! Tu mano szirdele, the little rascal!"""

"4482",140,"For three weeks after his injury Jurgis never got up from bed. It was"
"4483",140,"a very obstinate sprain; the swelling would not go down, and the pain"
"4484",140,"still continued. At the end of that time, however, he could contain"
"4485",140,"himself no longer, and began trying to walk a little every day, laboring"
"4486",140,"to persuade himself that he was better. No arguments could stop him, and"
"4487",140,"three or four days later he declared that he was going back to work. He"
"4488",140,"limped to the cars and got to Brown's, where he found that the boss had"
"4489",140,"kept his place--that is, was willing to turn out into the snow the poor"
"4490",140,"devil he had hired in the meantime. Every now and then the pain would"
"4491",140,"force Jurgis to stop work, but he stuck it out till nearly an hour"
"4492",140,"before closing. Then he was forced to acknowledge that he could not go"
"4493",140,"on without fainting; it almost broke his heart to do it, and he stood"
"4494",140,"leaning against a pillar and weeping like a child. Two of the men had to"
"4495",140,"help him to the car, and when he got out he had to sit down and wait in"
"4496",140,"the snow till some one came along."
"4497",140,""
"4498",140,"So they put him to bed again, and sent for the doctor, as they ought to"
"4499",140,"have done in the beginning. It transpired that he had twisted a tendon"
"4500",140,"out of place, and could never have gotten well without attention. Then"
"4501",140,"he gripped the sides of the bed, and shut his teeth together, and turned"
"4502",140,"white with agony, while the doctor pulled and wrenched away at his"
"4503",140,"swollen ankle. When finally the doctor left, he told him that he would"
"4504",140,"have to lie quiet for two months, and that if he went to work before"

"4506",140,""
"4507",140,"Three days later there came another heavy snowstorm, and Jonas and"
"4508",140,"Marija and Ona and little Stanislovas all set out together, an hour"
"4509",140,"before daybreak, to try to get to the yards. About noon the last two"
"4510",140,"came back, the boy screaming with pain. His fingers were all frosted,"
"4511",140,"it seemed. They had had to give up trying to get to the yards, and had"
"4512",140,"nearly perished in a drift. All that they knew how to do was to hold the"
"4513",140,"frozen fingers near the fire, and so little Stanislovas spent most of"
"4514",140,"the day dancing about in horrible agony, till Jurgis flew into a passion"

"4529",140,"that thereafter he always had to be beaten before he set out to work,"
"4530",140,"whenever there was fresh snow on the ground. Jurgis was called upon to"
"4531",140,"do the beating, and as it hurt his foot he did it with a vengeance; but"
"4532",140,"it did not tend to add to the sweetness of his temper. They say that the"
"4533",140,"best dog will turn cross if he be kept chained all the time, and it"
"4534",140,"was the same with the man; he had not a thing to do all day but lie and"
"4535",140,"curse his fate, and the time came when he wanted to curse everything."
"4536",140,""
"4537",140,"This was never for very long, however, for when Ona began to cry, Jurgis"
"4538",140,"could not stay angry. The poor fellow looked like a homeless ghost, with"
"4539",140,"his cheeks sunken in and his long black hair straggling into his eyes;"
"4540",140,"he was too discouraged to cut it, or to think about his appearance. His"
"4541",140,"muscles were wasting away, and what were left were soft and flabby. He"
"4542",140,"had no appetite, and they could not afford to tempt him with delicacies."
"4543",140,"It was better, he said, that he should not eat, it was a saving. About"
"4544",140,"the end of March he had got hold of Ona's bankbook, and learned that"
"4545",140,"there was only three dollars left to them in the world."
"4546",140,""
"4547",140,"But perhaps the worst of the consequences of this long siege was that"
"4548",140,"they lost another member of their family; Brother Jonas disappeared. One"
"4549",140,"Saturday night he did not come home, and thereafter all their efforts to"
"4550",140,"get trace of him were futile. It was said by the boss at Durham's that"
"4551",140,"he had gotten his week's money and left there. That might not be true,"
"4552",140,"of course, for sometimes they would say that when a man had been killed;"
"4553",140,"it was the easiest way out of it for all concerned. When, for instance,"
"4554",140,"a man had fallen into one of the rendering tanks and had been made into"
"4555",140,"pure leaf lard and peerless fertilizer, there was no use letting the"
"4556",140,"fact out and making his family unhappy. More probable, however, was"
"4557",140,"the theory that Jonas had deserted them, and gone on the road, seeking"
"4558",140,"happiness. He had been discontented for a long time, and not without"
"4559",140,"some cause. He paid good board, and was yet obliged to live in a family"
"4560",140,"where nobody had enough to eat. And Marija would keep giving them all"
"4561",140,"her money, and of course he could not but feel that he was called upon"
"4562",140,"to do the same. Then there were crying brats, and all sorts of misery;"
"4563",140,"a man would have had to be a good deal of a hero to stand it all without"
"4564",140,"grumbling, and Jonas was not in the least a hero--he was simply a"
"4565",140,"weatherbeaten old fellow who liked to have a good supper and sit in the"
"4566",140,"corner by the fire and smoke his pipe in peace before he went to bed."
"4567",140,"Here there was not room by the fire, and through the winter the kitchen"
"4568",140,"had seldom been warm enough for comfort. So, with the springtime, what"
"4569",140,"was more likely than that the wild idea of escaping had come to him?"
"4570",140,"Two years he had been yoked like a horse to a half-ton truck in Durham's"
"4571",140,"dark cellars, with never a rest, save on Sundays and four holidays in"
"4572",140,"the year, and with never a word of thanks--only kicks and blows and"
"4573",140,"curses, such as no decent dog would have stood. And now the winter was"
"4574",140,"over, and the spring winds were blowing--and with a day's walk a man"
"4575",140,"might put the smoke of Packingtown behind him forever, and be where the"
"4576",140,"grass was green and the flowers all the colors of the rainbow!"
"4577",140,""
"4578",140,"But now the income of the family was cut down more than one-third, and"
"4579",140,"the food demand was cut only one-eleventh, so that they were worse off"
"4580",140,"than ever. Also they were borrowing money from Marija, and eating up"
"4581",140,"her bank account, and spoiling once again her hopes of marriage and"
"4582",140,"happiness. And they were even going into debt to Tamoszius Kuszleika"
"4583",140,"and letting him impoverish himself. Poor Tamoszius was a man without"
"4584",140,"any relatives, and with a wonderful talent besides, and he ought to"
"4585",140,"have made money and prospered; but he had fallen in love, and so given"
"4586",140,"hostages to fortune, and was doomed to be dragged down too."
"4587",140,""
"4588",140,"So it was finally decided that two more of the children would have to"
"4589",140,"leave school. Next to Stanislovas, who was now fifteen, there was a"
"4590",140,"girl, little Kotrina, who was two years younger, and then two boys,"
"4591",140,"Vilimas, who was eleven, and Nikalojus, who was ten. Both of these last"
"4592",140,"were bright boys, and there was no reason why their family should starve"
"4593",140,"when tens of thousands of children no older were earning their own"
"4594",140,"livings. So one morning they were given a quarter apiece and a roll with"
"4595",140,"a sausage in it, and, with their minds top-heavy with good advice, were"
"4596",140,"sent out to make their way to the city and learn to sell newspapers."
"4597",140,"They came back late at night in tears, having walked for the five or"
"4598",140,"six miles to report that a man had offered to take them to a place where"
"4599",140,"they sold newspapers, and had taken their money and gone into a store to"
"4600",140,"get them, and nevermore been seen. So they both received a whipping, and"
"4601",140,"the next morning set out again. This time they found the newspaper"
"4602",140,"place, and procured their stock; and after wandering about till nearly"
"4603",140,"noontime, saying ""Paper?"" to every one they saw, they had all their"
"4604",140,"stock taken away and received a thrashing besides from a big newsman"
"4605",140,"upon whose territory they had trespassed. Fortunately, however, they"
"4606",140,"had already sold some papers, and came back with nearly as much as they"
"4607",140,"started with."
"4608",140,""
"4609",140,"After a week of mishaps such as these, the two little fellows began to"
"4610",140,"learn the ways of the trade--the names of the different papers, and how"
"4611",140,"many of each to get, and what sort of people to offer them to, and where"
"4612",140,"to go and where to stay away from. After this, leaving home at four"
"4613",140,"o'clock in the morning, and running about the streets, first with"
"4614",140,"morning papers and then with evening, they might come home late at night"
"4615",140,"with twenty or thirty cents apiece--possibly as much as forty cents."
"4616",140,"From this they had to deduct their carfare, since the distance was so"
"4617",140,"great; but after a while they made friends, and learned still more, and"
"4618",140,"then they would save their carfare. They would get on a car when the"
"4619",140,"conductor was not looking, and hide in the crowd; and three times out"
"4620",140,"of four he would not ask for their fares, either not seeing them,"
"4621",140,"or thinking they had already paid; or if he did ask, they would hunt"
"4622",140,"through their pockets, and then begin to cry, and either have their"
"4623",140,"fares paid by some kind old lady, or else try the trick again on a new"
"4624",140,"car. All this was fair play, they felt. Whose fault was it that at the"
"4625",140,"hours when workingmen were going to their work and back, the cars were"
"4626",140,"so crowded that the conductors could not collect all the fares? And"
"4627",140,"besides, the companies were thieves, people said--had stolen all their"
"4628",140,"franchises with the help of scoundrelly politicians!"
"4629",140,""
"4630",140,"Now that the winter was by, and there was no more danger of snow, and no"
"4631",140,"more coal to buy, and another room warm enough to put the children into"
"4632",140,"when they cried, and enough money to get along from week to week"
"4633",140,"with, Jurgis was less terrible than he had been. A man can get used"
"4634",140,"to anything in the course of time, and Jurgis had gotten used to lying"
"4635",140,"about the house. Ona saw this, and was very careful not to destroy his"
"4636",140,"peace of mind, by letting him know how very much pain she was suffering."
"4637",140,"It was now the time of the spring rains, and Ona had often to ride to"
"4638",140,"her work, in spite of the expense; she was getting paler every day, and"
"4639",140,"sometimes, in spite of her good resolutions, it pained her that Jurgis"
"4640",140,"did not notice it. She wondered if he cared for her as much as ever, if"
"4641",140,"all this misery was not wearing out his love. She had to be away from"
"4642",140,"him all the time, and bear her own troubles while he was bearing his;"
"4643",140,"and then, when she came home, she was so worn out; and whenever they"
"4644",140,"talked they had only their worries to talk of--truly it was hard, in"
"4645",140,"such a life, to keep any sentiment alive. The woe of this would flame up"
"4646",140,"in Ona sometimes--at night she would suddenly clasp her big husband"
"4647",140,"in her arms and break into passionate weeping, demanding to know if"
"4648",140,"he really loved her. Poor Jurgis, who had in truth grown more"
"4649",140,"matter-of-fact, under the endless pressure of penury, would not know"
"4650",140,"what to make of these things, and could only try to recollect when"
"4651",140,"he had last been cross; and so Ona would have to forgive him and sob"
"4652",140,"herself to sleep."
"4653",140,""
"4654",140,"The latter part of April Jurgis went to see the doctor, and was given a"
"4655",140,"bandage to lace about his ankle, and told that he might go back to work."
"4656",140,"It needed more than the permission of the doctor, however, for when he"
"4657",140,"showed up on the killing floor of Brown's, he was told by the foreman"
"4658",140,"that it had not been possible to keep his job for him. Jurgis knew that"
"4659",140,"this meant simply that the foreman had found some one else to do the"
"4660",140,"work as well and did not want to bother to make a change. He stood in"
"4661",140,"the doorway, looking mournfully on, seeing his friends and companions at"
"4662",140,"work, and feeling like an outcast. Then he went out and took his place"
"4663",140,"with the mob of the unemployed."
"4664",140,""
"4665",140,"This time, however, Jurgis did not have the same fine confidence, nor"
"4666",140,"the same reason for it. He was no longer the finest-looking man in the"
"4667",140,"throng, and the bosses no longer made for him; he was thin and haggard,"
"4668",140,"and his clothes were seedy, and he looked miserable. And there were"
"4669",140,"hundreds who looked and felt just like him, and who had been wandering"
"4670",140,"about Packingtown for months begging for work. This was a critical time"
"4671",140,"in Jurgis' life, and if he had been a weaker man he would have gone"
"4672",140,"the way the rest did. Those out-of-work wretches would stand about the"
"4673",140,"packing houses every morning till the police drove them away, and then"
"4674",140,"they would scatter among the saloons. Very few of them had the nerve"
"4675",140,"to face the rebuffs that they would encounter by trying to get into the"
"4676",140,"buildings to interview the bosses; if they did not get a chance in the"
"4677",140,"morning, there would be nothing to do but hang about the saloons the"
"4678",140,"rest of the day and night. Jurgis was saved from all this--partly, to"
"4679",140,"be sure, because it was pleasant weather, and there was no need to"
"4680",140,"be indoors; but mainly because he carried with him always the pitiful"
"4681",140,"little face of his wife. He must get work, he told himself, fighting"
"4682",140,"the battle with despair every hour of the day. He must get work! He must"
"4683",140,"have a place again and some money saved up, before the next winter came."
"4684",140,""
"4685",140,"But there was no work for him. He sought out all the members of his"
"4686",140,"union--Jurgis had stuck to the union through all this--and begged them"
"4687",140,"to speak a word for him. He went to every one he knew, asking for a"
"4688",140,"chance, there or anywhere. He wandered all day through the buildings;"
"4689",140,"and in a week or two, when he had been all over the yards, and into"
"4690",140,"every room to which he had access, and learned that there was not a job"
"4691",140,"anywhere, he persuaded himself that there might have been a change in"
"4692",140,"the places he had first visited, and began the round all over; till"
"4693",140,"finally the watchmen and the ""spotters"" of the companies came to know"
"4694",140,"him by sight and to order him out with threats. Then there was nothing"
"4695",140,"more for him to do but go with the crowd in the morning, and keep in"
"4696",140,"the front row and look eager, and when he failed, go back home, and play"
"4697",140,"with little Kotrina and the baby."
"4698",140,""
"4699",140,"The peculiar bitterness of all this was that Jurgis saw so plainly the"
"4700",140,"meaning of it. In the beginning he had been fresh and strong, and he"
"4701",140,"had gotten a job the first day; but now he was second-hand, a damaged"
"4702",140,"article, so to speak, and they did not want him. They had got the"
"4703",140,"best of him--they had worn him out, with their speeding-up and their"
"4704",140,"carelessness, and now they had thrown him away! And Jurgis would make"
"4705",140,"the acquaintance of others of these unemployed men and find that they"
"4706",140,"had all had the same experience. There were some, of course, who had"
"4707",140,"wandered in from other places, who had been ground up in other mills;"
"4708",140,"there were others who were out from their own fault--some, for instance,"
"4709",140,"who had not been able to stand the awful grind without drink. The vast"
"4710",140,"majority, however, were simply the worn-out parts of the great merciless"
"4711",140,"packing machine; they had toiled there, and kept up with the pace, some"
"4712",140,"of them for ten or twenty years, until finally the time had come when"
"4713",140,"they could not keep up with it any more. Some had been frankly told"
"4714",140,"that they were too old, that a sprier man was needed; others had given"
"4715",140,"occasion, by some act of carelessness or incompetence; with most,"
"4716",140,"however, the occasion had been the same as with Jurgis. They had been"
"4717",140,"overworked and underfed so long, and finally some disease had laid them"
"4718",140,"on their backs; or they had cut themselves, and had blood poisoning, or"
"4719",140,"met with some other accident. When a man came back after that, he would"
"4720",140,"get his place back only by the courtesy of the boss. To this there was"
"4721",140,"no exception, save when the accident was one for which the firm was"
"4722",140,"liable; in that case they would send a slippery lawyer to see him, first"
"4723",140,"to try to get him to sign away his claims, but if he was too smart for"
"4724",140,"that, to promise him that he and his should always be provided with"
"4725",140,"work. This promise they would keep, strictly and to the letter--for two"
"4726",140,"years. Two years was the ""statute of limitations,"" and after that the"
"4727",140,"victim could not sue."
"4728",140,""
"4729",140,"What happened to a man after any of these things, all depended upon"
"4730",140,"the circumstances. If he were of the highly skilled workers, he would"
"4731",140,"probably have enough saved up to tide him over. The best paid men,"
"4732",140,"the ""splitters,"" made fifty cents an hour, which would be five or six"
"4733",140,"dollars a day in the rush seasons, and one or two in the dullest. A"
"4734",140,"man could live and save on that; but then there were only half a dozen"
"4735",140,"splitters in each place, and one of them that Jurgis knew had a family"
"4736",140,"of twenty-two children, all hoping to grow up to be splitters like their"
"4737",140,"father. For an unskilled man, who made ten dollars a week in the rush"
"4738",140,"seasons and five in the dull, it all depended upon his age and the"
"4739",140,"number he had dependent upon him. An unmarried man could save, if he did"
"4740",140,"not drink, and if he was absolutely selfish--that is, if he paid no"
"4741",140,"heed to the demands of his old parents, or of his little brothers and"
"4742",140,"sisters, or of any other relatives he might have, as well as of the"
"4743",140,"members of his union, and his chums, and the people who might be"
"4744",140,"starving to death next door."

"4750",140,""
"4751",140,"During this time that Jurgis was looking for work occurred the death"
"4752",140,"of little Kristoforas, one of the children of Teta Elzbieta. Both"
"4753",140,"Kristoforas and his brother, Juozapas, were cripples, the latter having"
"4754",140,"lost one leg by having it run over, and Kristoforas having congenital"
"4755",140,"dislocation of the hip, which made it impossible for him ever to walk."
"4756",140,"He was the last of Teta Elzbieta's children, and perhaps he had been"
"4757",140,"intended by nature to let her know that she had had enough. At any rate"
"4758",140,"he was wretchedly sick and undersized; he had the rickets, and though"
"4759",140,"he was over three years old, he was no bigger than an ordinary child"
"4760",140,"of one. All day long he would crawl around the floor in a filthy little"
"4761",140,"dress, whining and fretting; because the floor was full of drafts he was"
"4762",140,"always catching cold, and snuffling because his nose ran. This made"
"4763",140,"him a nuisance, and a source of endless trouble in the family. For his"
"4764",140,"mother, with unnatural perversity, loved him best of all her children,"
"4765",140,"and made a perpetual fuss over him--would let him do anything"
"4766",140,"undisturbed, and would burst into tears when his fretting drove Jurgis"
"4767",140,"wild."
"4768",140,""
"4769",140,"And now he died. Perhaps it was the smoked sausage he had eaten that"
"4770",140,"morning--which may have been made out of some of the tubercular pork"
"4771",140,"that was condemned as unfit for export. At any rate, an hour after"
"4772",140,"eating it, the child had begun to cry with pain, and in another hour he"
"4773",140,"was rolling about on the floor in convulsions. Little Kotrina, who was"
"4774",140,"all alone with him, ran out screaming for help, and after a while a"
"4775",140,"doctor came, but not until Kristoforas had howled his last howl. No one"
"4776",140,"was really sorry about this except poor Elzbieta, who was inconsolable."
"4777",140,"Jurgis announced that so far as he was concerned the child would have"
"4778",140,"to be buried by the city, since they had no money for a funeral; and at"
"4779",140,"this the poor woman almost went out of her senses, wringing her hands"
"4780",140,"and screaming with grief and despair. Her child to be buried in a"
"4781",140,"pauper's grave! And her stepdaughter to stand by and hear it said"
"4782",140,"without protesting! It was enough to make Ona's father rise up out of"
"4783",140,"his grave to rebuke her! If it had come to this, they might as well give"
"4784",140,"up at once, and be buried all of them together! . . . In the end Marija"
"4785",140,"said that she would help with ten dollars; and Jurgis being still"
"4786",140,"obdurate, Elzbieta went in tears and begged the money from the"
"4787",140,"neighbors, and so little Kristoforas had a mass and a hearse with white"
"4788",140,"plumes on it, and a tiny plot in a graveyard with a wooden cross to mark"
"4789",140,"the place. The poor mother was not the same for months after that; the"
"4790",140,"mere sight of the floor where little Kristoforas had crawled about would"
"4791",140,"make her weep. He had never had a fair chance, poor little fellow, she"
"4792",140,"would say. He had been handicapped from his birth. If only she had heard"
"4793",140,"about it in time, so that she might have had that great doctor to cure"
"4794",140,"him of his lameness! . . . Some time ago, Elzbieta was told, a Chicago"
"4795",140,"billionaire had paid a fortune to bring a great European surgeon over to"
"4796",140,"cure his little daughter of the same disease from which Kristoforas had"
"4797",140,"suffered. And because this surgeon had to have bodies to demonstrate"
"4798",140,"upon, he announced that he would treat the children of the poor, a piece"
"4799",140,"of magnanimity over which the papers became quite eloquent. Elzbieta,"
"4800",140,"alas, did not read the papers, and no one had told her; but perhaps it"
"4801",140,"was as well, for just then they would not have had the carfare to spare"
"4802",140,"to go every day to wait upon the surgeon, nor for that matter anybody"
"4803",140,"with the time to take the child."

"4805",140,""
"4806",140,"All this while that he was seeking for work, there was a dark shadow"
"4807",140,"hanging over Jurgis; as if a savage beast were lurking somewhere in the"
"4808",140,"pathway of his life, and he knew it, and yet could not help approaching"
"4809",140,"the place. There are all stages of being out of work in Packingtown, and"
"4810",140,"he faced in dread the prospect of reaching the lowest. There is a place"
"4811",140,"that waits for the lowest man--the fertilizer plant!"
"4812",140,""
"4813",140,"The men would talk about it in awe-stricken whispers. Not more than one"
"4814",140,"in ten had ever really tried it; the other nine had contented themselves"
"4815",140,"with hearsay evidence and a peep through the door. There were some"
"4816",140,"things worse than even starving to death. They would ask Jurgis if he"
"4817",140,"had worked there yet, and if he meant to; and Jurgis would debate the"
"4818",140,"matter with himself. As poor as they were, and making all the sacrifices"
"4819",140,"that they were, would he dare to refuse any sort of work that was"
"4820",140,"offered to him, be it as horrible as ever it could? Would he dare to go"

"4822",140,"she was, knowing that he had been given a chance, and had not had the"
"4823",140,"nerve to take it?--And yet he might argue that way with himself all"
"4824",140,"day, and one glimpse into the fertilizer works would send him away again"
"4825",140,"shuddering. He was a man, and he would do his duty; he went and made"
"4826",140,"application--but surely he was not also required to hope for success!"
"4827",140,""
"4828",140,"The fertilizer works of Durham's lay away from the rest of the plant."
"4829",140,"Few visitors ever saw them, and the few who did would come out looking"
"4830",140,"like Dante, of whom the peasants declared that he had been into hell. To"
"4831",140,"this part of the yards came all the ""tankage"" and the waste products of"
"4832",140,"all sorts; here they dried out the bones,--and in suffocating cellars"
"4833",140,"where the daylight never came you might see men and women and children"
"4834",140,"bending over whirling machines and sawing bits of bone into all sorts of"
"4835",140,"shapes, breathing their lungs full of the fine dust, and doomed to die,"
"4836",140,"every one of them, within a certain definite time. Here they made the"
"4837",140,"blood into albumen, and made other foul-smelling things into things"
"4838",140,"still more foul-smelling. In the corridors and caverns where it was done"
"4839",140,"you might lose yourself as in the great caves of Kentucky. In the dust"
"4840",140,"and the steam the electric lights would shine like far-off twinkling"
"4841",140,"stars--red and blue-green and purple stars, according to the color of"
"4842",140,"the mist and the brew from which it came. For the odors of these ghastly"
"4843",140,"charnel houses there may be words in Lithuanian, but there are none in"
"4844",140,"English. The person entering would have to summon his courage as for a"
"4845",140,"cold-water plunge. He would go in like a man swimming under water; he"
"4846",140,"would put his handkerchief over his face, and begin to cough and choke;"
"4847",140,"and then, if he were still obstinate, he would find his head beginning"
"4848",140,"to ring, and the veins in his forehead to throb, until finally he would"
"4849",140,"be assailed by an overpowering blast of ammonia fumes, and would turn"
"4850",140,"and run for his life, and come out half-dazed."
"4851",140,""
"4852",140,"On top of this were the rooms where they dried the ""tankage,"" the mass"
"4853",140,"of brown stringy stuff that was left after the waste portions of the"
"4854",140,"carcasses had had the lard and tallow dried out of them. This dried"
"4855",140,"material they would then grind to a fine powder, and after they had"
"4856",140,"mixed it up well with a mysterious but inoffensive brown rock which they"
"4857",140,"brought in and ground up by the hundreds of carloads for that purpose,"
"4858",140,"the substance was ready to be put into bags and sent out to the world"
"4859",140,"as any one of a hundred different brands of standard bone phosphate. And"
"4860",140,"then the farmer in Maine or California or Texas would buy this, at say"
"4861",140,"twenty-five dollars a ton, and plant it with his corn; and for several"
"4862",140,"days after the operation the fields would have a strong odor, and the"
"4863",140,"farmer and his wagon and the very horses that had hauled it would all"
"4864",140,"have it too. In Packingtown the fertilizer is pure, instead of being a"
"4865",140,"flavoring, and instead of a ton or so spread out on several acres under"
"4866",140,"the open sky, there are hundreds and thousands of tons of it in one"
"4867",140,"building, heaped here and there in haystack piles, covering the floor"
"4868",140,"several inches deep, and filling the air with a choking dust that"
"4869",140,"becomes a blinding sandstorm when the wind stirs."
"4870",140,""
"4871",140,"It was to this building that Jurgis came daily, as if dragged by an"
"4872",140,"unseen hand. The month of May was an exceptionally cool one, and"
"4873",140,"his secret prayers were granted; but early in June there came a"
"4874",140,"record-breaking hot spell, and after that there were men wanted in the"
"4875",140,"fertilizer mill."
"4876",140,""
"4877",140,"The boss of the grinding room had come to know Jurgis by this time, and"
"4878",140,"had marked him for a likely man; and so when he came to the door about"
"4879",140,"two o'clock this breathless hot day, he felt a sudden spasm of pain"
"4880",140,"shoot through him--the boss beckoned to him! In ten minutes more Jurgis"
"4881",140,"had pulled off his coat and overshirt, and set his teeth together and"
"4882",140,"gone to work. Here was one more difficulty for him to meet and conquer!"
"4883",140,""
"4884",140,"His labor took him about one minute to learn. Before him was one of"
"4885",140,"the vents of the mill in which the fertilizer was being ground--rushing"
"4886",140,"forth in a great brown river, with a spray of the finest dust flung"
"4887",140,"forth in clouds. Jurgis was given a shovel, and along with half a dozen"
"4888",140,"others it was his task to shovel this fertilizer into carts. That others"
"4889",140,"were at work he knew by the sound, and by the fact that he sometimes"
"4890",140,"collided with them; otherwise they might as well not have been there,"
"4891",140,"for in the blinding dust storm a man could not see six feet in front of"
"4892",140,"his face. When he had filled one cart he had to grope around him until"
"4893",140,"another came, and if there was none on hand he continued to grope till"
"4894",140,"one arrived. In five minutes he was, of course, a mass of fertilizer"
"4895",140,"from head to feet; they gave him a sponge to tie over his mouth, so that"
"4896",140,"he could breathe, but the sponge did not prevent his lips and eyelids"
"4897",140,"from caking up with it and his ears from filling solid. He looked like"
"4898",140,"a brown ghost at twilight--from hair to shoes he became the color of the"
"4899",140,"building and of everything in it, and for that matter a hundred yards"
"4900",140,"outside it. The building had to be left open, and when the wind blew"
"4901",140,"Durham and Company lost a great deal of fertilizer."
"4902",140,""
"4903",140,"Working in his shirt sleeves, and with the thermometer at over a"
"4904",140,"hundred, the phosphates soaked in through every pore of Jurgis' skin,"
"4905",140,"and in five minutes he had a headache, and in fifteen was almost dazed."
"4906",140,"The blood was pounding in his brain like an engine's throbbing; there"
"4907",140,"was a frightful pain in the top of his skull, and he could hardly"
"4908",140,"control his hands. Still, with the memory of his four months' siege"
"4909",140,"behind him, he fought on, in a frenzy of determination; and half an hour"
"4910",140,"later he began to vomit--he vomited until it seemed as if his inwards"
"4911",140,"must be torn into shreds. A man could get used to the fertilizer mill,"
"4912",140,"the boss had said, if he would make up his mind to it; but Jurgis now"
"4913",140,"began to see that it was a question of making up his stomach."
"4914",140,""
"4915",140,"At the end of that day of horror, he could scarcely stand. He had to"
"4916",140,"catch himself now and then, and lean against a building and get his"
"4917",140,"bearings. Most of the men, when they came out, made straight for a"
"4918",140,"saloon--they seemed to place fertilizer and rattlesnake poison in one"
"4919",140,"class. But Jurgis was too ill to think of drinking--he could only make"
"4920",140,"his way to the street and stagger on to a car. He had a sense of humor,"
"4921",140,"and later on, when he became an old hand, he used to think it fun to"
"4922",140,"board a streetcar and see what happened. Now, however, he was too ill to"
"4923",140,"notice it--how the people in the car began to gasp and sputter, to"
"4924",140,"put their handkerchiefs to their noses, and transfix him with furious"
"4925",140,"glances. Jurgis only knew that a man in front of him immediately got up"
"4926",140,"and gave him a seat; and that half a minute later the two people on each"
"4927",140,"side of him got up; and that in a full minute the crowded car was nearly"
"4928",140,"empty--those passengers who could not get room on the platform having"
"4929",140,"gotten out to walk."
"4930",140,""
"4931",140,"Of course Jurgis had made his home a miniature fertilizer mill a minute"
"4932",140,"after entering. The stuff was half an inch deep in his skin--his whole"
"4933",140,"system was full of it, and it would have taken a week not merely of"
"4934",140,"scrubbing, but of vigorous exercise, to get it out of him. As it was, he"
"4935",140,"could be compared with nothing known to men, save that newest discovery"
"4936",140,"of the savants, a substance which emits energy for an unlimited time,"
"4937",140,"without being itself in the least diminished in power. He smelled so"
"4938",140,"that he made all the food at the table taste, and set the whole family"
"4939",140,"to vomiting; for himself it was three days before he could keep anything"
"4940",140,"upon his stomach--he might wash his hands, and use a knife and fork, but"
"4941",140,"were not his mouth and throat filled with the poison?"
"4942",140,""
"4943",140,"And still Jurgis stuck it out! In spite of splitting headaches he would"
"4944",140,"stagger down to the plant and take up his stand once more, and begin to"
"4945",140,"shovel in the blinding clouds of dust. And so at the end of the week he"
"4946",140,"was a fertilizer man for life--he was able to eat again, and though"
"4947",140,"his head never stopped aching, it ceased to be so bad that he could not"
"4948",140,"work."
"4949",140,""
"4950",140,""
"4951",140,"So there passed another summer. It was a summer of prosperity, all over"
"4952",140,"the country, and the country ate generously of packing house products,"
"4953",140,"and there was plenty of work for all the family, in spite of the"
"4954",140,"packers' efforts to keep a superfluity of labor. They were again able to"
"4955",140,"pay their debts and to begin to save a little sum; but there were one or"
"4956",140,"two sacrifices they considered too heavy to be made for long--it was"
"4957",140,"too bad that the boys should have to sell papers at their age. It was"
"4958",140,"utterly useless to caution them and plead with them; quite without"
"4959",140,"knowing it, they were taking on the tone of their new environment. They"
"4960",140,"were learning to swear in voluble English; they were learning to pick up"
"4961",140,"cigar stumps and smoke them, to pass hours of their time gambling with"
"4962",140,"pennies and dice and cigarette cards; they were learning the location"
"4963",140,"of all the houses of prostitution on the ""Levee,"" and the names of"
"4964",140,"the ""madames"" who kept them, and the days when they gave their state"
"4965",140,"banquets, which the police captains and the big politicians all"
"4966",140,"attended. If a visiting ""country customer"" were to ask them, they could"
"4967",140,"show him which was ""Hinkydink's"" famous saloon, and could even point out"
"4968",140,"to him by name the different gamblers and thugs and ""hold-up men"" who"
"4969",140,"made the place their headquarters. And worse yet, the boys were getting"
"4970",140,"out of the habit of coming home at night. What was the use, they would"
"4971",140,"ask, of wasting time and energy and a possible carfare riding out to"
"4972",140,"the stockyards every night when the weather was pleasant and they could"
"4973",140,"crawl under a truck or into an empty doorway and sleep exactly as well?"
"4974",140,"So long as they brought home a half dollar for each day, what mattered"
"4975",140,"it when they brought it? But Jurgis declared that from this to ceasing"
"4976",140,"to come at all would not be a very long step, and so it was decided"
"4977",140,"that Vilimas and Nikalojus should return to school in the fall, and"
"4978",140,"that instead Elzbieta should go out and get some work, her place at home"
"4979",140,"being taken by her younger daughter."
"4980",140,""
"4981",140,"Little Kotrina was like most children of the poor, prematurely made old;"
"4982",140,"she had to take care of her little brother, who was a cripple, and also"
"4983",140,"of the baby; she had to cook the meals and wash the dishes and clean"
"4984",140,"house, and have supper ready when the workers came home in the evening."
"4985",140,"She was only thirteen, and small for her age, but she did all this"
"4986",140,"without a murmur; and her mother went out, and after trudging a couple"
"4987",140,"of days about the yards, settled down as a servant of a ""sausage"
"4988",140,"machine."""
"4989",140,""
"4990",140,"Elzbieta was used to working, but she found this change a hard one, for"
"4991",140,"the reason that she had to stand motionless upon her feet from seven"
"4992",140,"o'clock in the morning till half-past twelve, and again from one till"
"4993",140,"half-past five. For the first few days it seemed to her that she"
"4994",140,"could not stand it--she suffered almost as much as Jurgis had from the"
"4995",140,"fertilizer, and would come out at sundown with her head fairly reeling."
"4996",140,"Besides this, she was working in one of the dark holes, by electric"
"4997",140,"light, and the dampness, too, was deadly--there were always puddles of"
"4998",140,"water on the floor, and a sickening odor of moist flesh in the room. The"
"4999",140,"people who worked here followed the ancient custom of nature, whereby"
"5000",140,"the ptarmigan is the color of dead leaves in the fall and of snow in the"
"5001",140,"winter, and the chameleon, who is black when he lies upon a stump and"
"5002",140,"turns green when he moves to a leaf. The men and women who worked in"
"5003",140,"this department were precisely the color of the ""fresh country sausage"""
"5004",140,"they made."
"5005",140,""
"5006",140,"The sausage-room was an interesting place to visit, for two or three"
"5007",140,"minutes, and provided that you did not look at the people; the machines"
"5008",140,"were perhaps the most wonderful things in the entire plant. Presumably"
"5009",140,"sausages were once chopped and stuffed by hand, and if so it would"
"5010",140,"be interesting to know how many workers had been displaced by these"
"5011",140,"inventions. On one side of the room were the hoppers, into which men"
"5012",140,"shoveled loads of meat and wheelbarrows full of spices; in these great"
"5013",140,"bowls were whirling knives that made two thousand revolutions a minute,"
"5014",140,"and when the meat was ground fine and adulterated with potato flour,"
"5015",140,"and well mixed with water, it was forced to the stuffing machines on"
"5016",140,"the other side of the room. The latter were tended by women; there was"
"5017",140,"a sort of spout, like the nozzle of a hose, and one of the women would"
"5018",140,"take a long string of ""casing"" and put the end over the nozzle and then"
"5019",140,"work the whole thing on, as one works on the finger of a tight glove."
"5020",140,"This string would be twenty or thirty feet long, but the woman would"
"5021",140,"have it all on in a jiffy; and when she had several on, she would press"
"5022",140,"a lever, and a stream of sausage meat would be shot out, taking"
"5023",140,"the casing with it as it came. Thus one might stand and see appear,"
"5024",140,"miraculously born from the machine, a wriggling snake of sausage of"
"5025",140,"incredible length. In front was a big pan which caught these creatures,"
"5026",140,"and two more women who seized them as fast as they appeared and twisted"
"5027",140,"them into links. This was for the uninitiated the most perplexing work"
"5028",140,"of all; for all that the woman had to give was a single turn of the"
"5029",140,"wrist; and in some way she contrived to give it so that instead of an"
"5030",140,"endless chain of sausages, one after another, there grew under her hands"
"5031",140,"a bunch of strings, all dangling from a single center. It was quite like"
"5032",140,"the feat of a prestidigitator--for the woman worked so fast that the eye"
"5033",140,"could literally not follow her, and there was only a mist of motion,"
"5034",140,"and tangle after tangle of sausages appearing. In the midst of the mist,"
"5035",140,"however, the visitor would suddenly notice the tense set face, with"
"5036",140,"the two wrinkles graven in the forehead, and the ghastly pallor of the"
"5037",140,"cheeks; and then he would suddenly recollect that it was time he was"
"5038",140,"going on. The woman did not go on; she stayed right there--hour after"
"5039",140,"hour, day after day, year after year, twisting sausage links and racing"
"5040",140,"with death. It was piecework, and she was apt to have a family to keep"
"5041",140,"alive; and stern and ruthless economic laws had arranged it that she"
"5042",140,"could only do this by working just as she did, with all her soul upon"
"5043",140,"her work, and with never an instant for a glance at the well-dressed"
"5044",140,"ladies and gentlemen who came to stare at her, as at some wild beast in"

"5052",140,"With one member trimming beef in a cannery, and another working in a"

"5054",140,"majority of Packingtown swindles. For it was the custom, as they found,"
"5055",140,"whenever meat was so spoiled that it could not be used for anything"
"5056",140,"else, either to can it or else to chop it up into sausage. With what had"
"5057",140,"been told them by Jonas, who had worked in the pickle rooms, they could"
"5058",140,"now study the whole of the spoiled-meat industry on the inside, and read"
"5059",140,"a new and grim meaning into that old Packingtown jest--that they use"
"5060",140,"everything of the pig except the squeal."
"5061",140,""
"5062",140,"Jonas had told them how the meat that was taken out of pickle would"
"5063",140,"often be found sour, and how they would rub it up with soda to take away"
"5064",140,"the smell, and sell it to be eaten on free-lunch counters; also of all"
"5065",140,"the miracles of chemistry which they performed, giving to any sort of"
"5066",140,"meat, fresh or salted, whole or chopped, any color and any flavor and"
"5067",140,"any odor they chose. In the pickling of hams they had an ingenious"
"5068",140,"apparatus, by which they saved time and increased the capacity of the"
"5069",140,"plant--a machine consisting of a hollow needle attached to a pump; by"
"5070",140,"plunging this needle into the meat and working with his foot, a man"
"5071",140,"could fill a ham with pickle in a few seconds. And yet, in spite of"
"5072",140,"this, there would be hams found spoiled, some of them with an odor so"
"5073",140,"bad that a man could hardly bear to be in the room with them. To pump"
"5074",140,"into these the packers had a second and much stronger pickle which"
"5075",140,"destroyed the odor--a process known to the workers as ""giving them"
"5076",140,"thirty per cent."" Also, after the hams had been smoked, there would be"
"5077",140,"found some that had gone to the bad. Formerly these had been sold as"
"5078",140,"""Number Three Grade,"" but later on some ingenious person had hit upon"
"5079",140,"a new device, and now they would extract the bone, about which the bad"
"5080",140,"part generally lay, and insert in the hole a white-hot iron. After this"
"5081",140,"invention there was no longer Number One, Two, and Three Grade--there"
"5082",140,"was only Number One Grade. The packers were always originating such"
"5083",140,"schemes--they had what they called ""boneless hams,"" which were all the"
"5084",140,"odds and ends of pork stuffed into casings; and ""California hams,"" which"
"5085",140,"were the shoulders, with big knuckle joints, and nearly all the meat cut"
"5086",140,"out; and fancy ""skinned hams,"" which were made of the oldest hogs, whose"
"5087",140,"skins were so heavy and coarse that no one would buy them--that is,"
"5088",140,"until they had been cooked and chopped fine and labeled ""head cheese!"""
"5089",140,""
"5090",140,"It was only when the whole ham was spoiled that it came into the"
"5091",140,"department of Elzbieta. Cut up by the two-thousand-revolutions-a-minute"
"5092",140,"flyers, and mixed with half a ton of other meat, no odor that ever was"
"5093",140,"in a ham could make any difference. There was never the least attention"
"5094",140,"paid to what was cut up for sausage; there would come all the way back"
"5095",140,"from Europe old sausage that had been rejected, and that was moldy and"
"5096",140,"white--it would be dosed with borax and glycerine, and dumped into the"
"5097",140,"hoppers, and made over again for home consumption. There would be meat"
"5098",140,"that had tumbled out on the floor, in the dirt and sawdust, where the"
"5099",140,"workers had tramped and spit uncounted billions of consumption germs."
"5100",140,"There would be meat stored in great piles in rooms; and the water from"
"5101",140,"leaky roofs would drip over it, and thousands of rats would race about"
"5102",140,"on it. It was too dark in these storage places to see well, but a man"
"5103",140,"could run his hand over these piles of meat and sweep off handfuls of"
"5104",140,"the dried dung of rats. These rats were nuisances, and the packers would"
"5105",140,"put poisoned bread out for them; they would die, and then rats, bread,"
"5106",140,"and meat would go into the hoppers together. This is no fairy story and"
"5107",140,"no joke; the meat would be shoveled into carts, and the man who did"
"5108",140,"the shoveling would not trouble to lift out a rat even when he saw"
"5109",140,"one--there were things that went into the sausage in comparison with"
"5110",140,"which a poisoned rat was a tidbit. There was no place for the men"
"5111",140,"to wash their hands before they ate their dinner, and so they made a"
"5112",140,"practice of washing them in the water that was to be ladled into the"
"5113",140,"sausage. There were the butt-ends of smoked meat, and the scraps of"
"5114",140,"corned beef, and all the odds and ends of the waste of the plants, that"
"5115",140,"would be dumped into old barrels in the cellar and left there. Under the"
"5116",140,"system of rigid economy which the packers enforced, there were some jobs"
"5117",140,"that it only paid to do once in a long time, and among these was the"
"5118",140,"cleaning out of the waste barrels. Every spring they did it; and in"
"5119",140,"the barrels would be dirt and rust and old nails and stale water--and"
"5120",140,"cartload after cartload of it would be taken up and dumped into the"
"5121",140,"hoppers with fresh meat, and sent out to the public's breakfast. Some of"
"5122",140,"it they would make into ""smoked"" sausage--but as the smoking took"
"5123",140,"time, and was therefore expensive, they would call upon their chemistry"
"5124",140,"department, and preserve it with borax and color it with gelatine to"
"5125",140,"make it brown. All of their sausage came out of the same bowl, but when"
"5126",140,"they came to wrap it they would stamp some of it ""special,"" and for this"

"5129",140,""
"5130",140,"Such were the new surroundings in which Elzbieta was placed, and such"
"5131",140,"was the work she was compelled to do. It was stupefying, brutalizing"
"5132",140,"work; it left her no time to think, no strength for anything. She was"
"5133",140,"part of the machine she tended, and every faculty that was not needed"
"5134",140,"for the machine was doomed to be crushed out of existence. There was"
"5135",140,"only one mercy about the cruel grind--that it gave her the gift of"
"5136",140,"insensibility. Little by little she sank into a torpor--she fell silent."
"5137",140,"She would meet Jurgis and Ona in the evening, and the three would walk"
"5138",140,"home together, often without saying a word. Ona, too, was falling into a"
"5139",140,"habit of silence--Ona, who had once gone about singing like a bird. She"
"5140",140,"was sick and miserable, and often she would barely have strength enough"
"5141",140,"to drag herself home. And there they would eat what they had to eat, and"
"5142",140,"afterward, because there was only their misery to talk of, they would"
"5143",140,"crawl into bed and fall into a stupor and never stir until it was time"
"5144",140,"to get up again, and dress by candlelight, and go back to the machines."
"5145",140,"They were so numbed that they did not even suffer much from hunger, now;"
"5146",140,"only the children continued to fret when the food ran short."

"5150",140,"cruel times. The gates of memory would roll open--old joys would stretch"
"5151",140,"out their arms to them, old hopes and dreams would call to them, and"
"5152",140,"they would stir beneath the burden that lay upon them, and feel its"
"5153",140,"forever immeasurable weight. They could not even cry out beneath it; but"
"5154",140,"anguish would seize them, more dreadful than the agony of death. It was"
"5155",140,"a thing scarcely to be spoken--a thing never spoken by all the world,"
"5156",140,"that will not know its own defeat."
"5157",140,""
"5158",140,"They were beaten; they had lost the game, they were swept aside. It"
"5159",140,"was not less tragic because it was so sordid, because it had to do with"
"5160",140,"wages and grocery bills and rents. They had dreamed of freedom; of a"
"5161",140,"chance to look about them and learn something; to be decent and clean,"
"5162",140,"to see their child grow up to be strong. And now it was all gone--it"
"5163",140,"would never be! They had played the game and they had lost. Six years"
"5164",140,"more of toil they had to face before they could expect the least"
"5165",140,"respite, the cessation of the payments upon the house; and how cruelly"
"5166",140,"certain it was that they could never stand six years of such a life as"
"5167",140,"they were living! They were lost, they were going down--and there was"
"5168",140,"no deliverance for them, no hope; for all the help it gave them the vast"
"5169",140,"city in which they lived might have been an ocean waste, a wilderness, a"
"5170",140,"desert, a tomb. So often this mood would come to Ona, in the nighttime,"
"5171",140,"when something wakened her; she would lie, afraid of the beating of her"
"5172",140,"own heart, fronting the blood-red eyes of the old primeval terror of"
"5173",140,"life. Once she cried aloud, and woke Jurgis, who was tired and cross."
"5174",140,"After that she learned to weep silently--their moods so seldom came"

"5177",140,"Jurgis, being a man, had troubles of his own. There was another specter"

"5179",140,"else to speak of it--he had never acknowledged its existence to himself."
"5180",140,"Yet the battle with it took all the manhood that he had--and once or"
"5181",140,"twice, alas, a little more. Jurgis had discovered drink."

"5183",140,"He was working in the steaming pit of hell; day after day, week after"

"5186",140,"and night, and the buildings swayed and danced before him as he went"
"5187",140,"down the street. And from all the unending horror of this there was a"
"5188",140,"respite, a deliverance--he could drink! He could forget the pain, he"
"5189",140,"could slip off the burden; he would see clearly again, he would be"
"5190",140,"master of his brain, of his thoughts, of his will. His dead self would"
"5191",140,"stir in him, and he would find himself laughing and cracking jokes with"
"5192",140,"his companions--he would be a man again, and master of his life."
"5193",140,""
"5194",140,"It was not an easy thing for Jurgis to take more than two or three"
"5195",140,"drinks. With the first drink he could eat a meal, and he could persuade"
"5196",140,"himself that that was economy; with the second he could eat another"
"5197",140,"meal--but there would come a time when he could eat no more, and then"
"5198",140,"to pay for a drink was an unthinkable extravagance, a defiance of the"
"5199",140,"age-long instincts of his hunger-haunted class. One day, however, he took"
"5200",140,"the plunge, and drank up all that he had in his pockets, and went home"
"5201",140,"half ""piped,"" as the men phrase it. He was happier than he had been in a"
"5202",140,"year; and yet, because he knew that the happiness would not last, he was"
"5203",140,"savage, too with those who would wreck it, and with the world, and with"
"5204",140,"his life; and then again, beneath this, he was sick with the shame of"
"5205",140,"himself. Afterward, when he saw the despair of his family, and reckoned"
"5206",140,"up the money he had spent, the tears came into his eyes, and he began"
"5207",140,"the long battle with the specter."
"5208",140,""
"5209",140,"It was a battle that had no end, that never could have one. But Jurgis"
"5210",140,"did not realize that very clearly; he was not given much time for"
"5211",140,"reflection. He simply knew that he was always fighting. Steeped in"
"5212",140,"misery and despair as he was, merely to walk down the street was to be"
"5213",140,"put upon the rack. There was surely a saloon on the corner--perhaps on"
"5214",140,"all four corners, and some in the middle of the block as well; and each"
"5215",140,"one stretched out a hand to him each one had a personality of its own,"
"5216",140,"allurements unlike any other. Going and coming--before sunrise and"
"5217",140,"after dark--there was warmth and a glow of light, and the steam of hot"
"5218",140,"food, and perhaps music, or a friendly face, and a word of good cheer."
"5219",140,"Jurgis developed a fondness for having Ona on his arm whenever he went"
"5220",140,"out on the street, and he would hold her tightly, and walk fast. It was"
"5221",140,"pitiful to have Ona know of this--it drove him wild to think of it; the"
"5222",140,"thing was not fair, for Ona had never tasted drink, and so could not"
"5223",140,"understand. Sometimes, in desperate hours, he would find himself wishing"
"5224",140,"that she might learn what it was, so that he need not be ashamed in her"
"5225",140,"presence. They might drink together, and escape from the horror--escape"
"5226",140,"for a while, come what would."
"5227",140,""
"5228",140,"So there came a time when nearly all the conscious life of Jurgis"
"5229",140,"consisted of a struggle with the craving for liquor. He would have ugly"
"5230",140,"moods, when he hated Ona and the whole family, because they stood in his"
"5231",140,"way. He was a fool to have married; he had tied himself down, had made"
"5232",140,"himself a slave. It was all because he was a married man that he was"
"5233",140,"compelled to stay in the yards; if it had not been for that he might"
"5234",140,"have gone off like Jonas, and to hell with the packers. There were few"
"5235",140,"single men in the fertilizer mill--and those few were working only for a"
"5236",140,"chance to escape. Meantime, too, they had something to think about while"
"5237",140,"they worked,--they had the memory of the last time they had been drunk,"
"5238",140,"and the hope of the time when they would be drunk again. As for Jurgis,"
"5239",140,"he was expected to bring home every penny; he could not even go with"
"5240",140,"the men at noontime--he was supposed to sit down and eat his dinner on a"
"5241",140,"pile of fertilizer dust."
"5242",140,""
"5243",140,"This was not always his mood, of course; he still loved his family. But"
"5244",140,"just now was a time of trial. Poor little Antanas, for instance--who"
"5245",140,"had never failed to win him with a smile--little Antanas was not smiling"
"5246",140,"just now, being a mass of fiery red pimples. He had had all the diseases"
"5247",140,"that babies are heir to, in quick succession, scarlet fever, mumps, and"
"5248",140,"whooping cough in the first year, and now he was down with the measles."
"5249",140,"There was no one to attend him but Kotrina; there was no doctor to"
"5250",140,"help him, because they were too poor, and children did not die of the"
"5251",140,"measles--at least not often. Now and then Kotrina would find time to sob"
"5252",140,"over his woes, but for the greater part of the time he had to be left"
"5253",140,"alone, barricaded upon the bed. The floor was full of drafts, and if he"
"5254",140,"caught cold he would die. At night he was tied down, lest he should kick"
"5255",140,"the covers off him, while the family lay in their stupor of exhaustion."
"5256",140,"He would lie and scream for hours, almost in convulsions; and then, when"
"5257",140,"he was worn out, he would lie whimpering and wailing in his torment."
"5258",140,"He was burning up with fever, and his eyes were running sores; in"
"5259",140,"the daytime he was a thing uncanny and impish to behold, a plaster of"
"5260",140,"pimples and sweat, a great purple lump of misery."
"5261",140,""
"5262",140,"Yet all this was not really as cruel as it sounds, for, sick as he was,"
"5263",140,"little Antanas was the least unfortunate member of that family. He"
"5264",140,"was quite able to bear his sufferings--it was as if he had all these"
"5265",140,"complaints to show what a prodigy of health he was. He was the child of"
"5266",140,"his parents' youth and joy; he grew up like the conjurer's rosebush, and"
"5267",140,"all the world was his oyster. In general, he toddled around the kitchen"
"5268",140,"all day with a lean and hungry look--the portion of the family's"
"5269",140,"allowance that fell to him was not enough, and he was unrestrainable in"
"5270",140,"his demand for more. Antanas was but little over a year old, and already"
"5271",140,"no one but his father could manage him."
"5272",140,""
"5273",140,"It seemed as if he had taken all of his mother's strength--had left"
"5274",140,"nothing for those that might come after him. Ona was with child again"
"5275",140,"now, and it was a dreadful thing to contemplate; even Jurgis, dumb and"
"5276",140,"despairing as he was, could not but understand that yet other agonies"
"5277",140,"were on the way, and shudder at the thought of them."
"5278",140,""
"5279",140,"For Ona was visibly going to pieces. In the first place she was"
"5280",140,"developing a cough, like the one that had killed old Dede Antanas. She"
"5281",140,"had had a trace of it ever since that fatal morning when the greedy"
"5282",140,"streetcar corporation had turned her out into the rain; but now it was"
"5283",140,"beginning to grow serious, and to wake her up at night. Even worse than"
"5284",140,"that was the fearful nervousness from which she suffered; she would have"
"5285",140,"frightful headaches and fits of aimless weeping; and sometimes she would"
"5286",140,"come home at night shuddering and moaning, and would fling herself down"
"5287",140,"upon the bed and burst into tears. Several times she was quite beside"
"5288",140,"herself and hysterical; and then Jurgis would go half-mad with fright."
"5289",140,"Elzbieta would explain to him that it could not be helped, that a woman"
"5290",140,"was subject to such things when she was pregnant; but he was hardly to"
"5291",140,"be persuaded, and would beg and plead to know what had happened. She"
"5292",140,"had never been like this before, he would argue--it was monstrous and"
"5293",140,"unthinkable. It was the life she had to live, the accursed work she had"
"5294",140,"to do, that was killing her by inches. She was not fitted for it--no"
"5295",140,"woman was fitted for it, no woman ought to be allowed to do such work;"
"5296",140,"if the world could not keep them alive any other way it ought to kill"
"5297",140,"them at once and be done with it. They ought not to marry, to have"
"5298",140,"children; no workingman ought to marry--if he, Jurgis, had known what a"
"5299",140,"woman was like, he would have had his eyes torn out first. So he would"
"5300",140,"carry on, becoming half hysterical himself, which was an unbearable"
"5301",140,"thing to see in a big man; Ona would pull herself together and fling"
"5302",140,"herself into his arms, begging him to stop, to be still, that she would"
"5303",140,"be better, it would be all right. So she would lie and sob out her"
"5304",140,"grief upon his shoulder, while he gazed at her, as helpless as a wounded"
"5305",140,"animal, the target of unseen enemies."

"5316",140,"believe that there was some terrible thing about all this that he was"
"5317",140,"not allowed to know. Once or twice in these outbreaks he caught Ona's"

"5328",140,"be eaten at Christmas breakfasts; and Marija and Elzbieta and Ona, as"
"5329",140,"part of the machine, began working fifteen or sixteen hours a day. There"

"5337",140,"running overtime, and there was no place for him to wait save in a"
"5338",140,"saloon. Each would stagger out into the darkness, and make her way to"
"5339",140,"the corner, where they met; or if the others had already gone, would get"
"5340",140,"into a car, and begin a painful struggle to keep awake. When they got"
"5341",140,"home they were always too tired either to eat or to undress; they would"
"5342",140,"crawl into bed with their shoes on, and lie like logs. If they should"

"5426",140,"the snow still held, and the searching cold, morning after morning"
"5427",140,"Jurgis half carried his wife to her post, staggering with her through"
"5428",140,"the darkness; until at last, one night, came the end."
"5429",140,""
"5430",140,"It lacked but three days of the holidays. About midnight Marija and"
"5431",140,"Elzbieta came home, exclaiming in alarm when they found that Ona had not"
"5432",140,"come. The two had agreed to meet her; and, after waiting, had gone to"
"5433",140,"the room where she worked; only to find that the ham-wrapping girls had"
"5434",140,"quit work an hour before, and left. There was no snow that night, nor"
"5435",140,"was it especially cold; and still Ona had not come! Something more"
"5436",140,"serious must be wrong this time."
"5437",140,""
"5438",140,"They aroused Jurgis, and he sat up and listened crossly to the story."
"5439",140,"She must have gone home again with Jadvyga, he said; Jadvyga lived only"
"5440",140,"two blocks from the yards, and perhaps she had been tired. Nothing could"
"5441",140,"have happened to her--and even if there had, there was nothing could"
"5442",140,"be done about it until morning. Jurgis turned over in his bed, and was"
"5443",140,"snoring again before the two had closed the door."
"5444",140,""
"5445",140,"In the morning, however, he was up and out nearly an hour before the"
"5446",140,"usual time. Jadvyga Marcinkus lived on the other side of the yards,"
"5447",140,"beyond Halsted Street, with her mother and sisters, in a single basement"
"5448",140,"room--for Mikolas had recently lost one hand from blood poisoning, and"
"5449",140,"their marriage had been put off forever. The door of the room was in the"
"5450",140,"rear, reached by a narrow court, and Jurgis saw a light in the window"
"5451",140,"and heard something frying as he passed; he knocked, half expecting that"
"5452",140,"Ona would answer."
"5453",140,""
"5454",140,"Instead there was one of Jadvyga's little sisters, who gazed at him"
"5455",140,"through a crack in the door. ""Where's Ona?"" he demanded; and the child"
"5456",140,"looked at him in perplexity. ""Ona?"" she said."
"5457",140,""
"5458",140,"""Yes,"" said Jurgis, ""isn't she here?"""
"5459",140,""
"5460",140,"""No,"" said the child, and Jurgis gave a start. A moment later came"
"5461",140,"Jadvyga, peering over the child's head. When she saw who it was, she"
"5462",140,"slid around out of sight, for she was not quite dressed. Jurgis must"
"5463",140,"excuse her, she began, her mother was very ill--"
"5464",140,""
"5465",140,"""Ona isn't here?"" Jurgis demanded, too alarmed to wait for her to"
"5466",140,"finish."
"5467",140,""
"5468",140,"""Why, no,"" said Jadvyga. ""What made you think she would be here? Had she"
"5469",140,"said she was coming?"""
"5470",140,""
"5471",140,"""No,"" he answered. ""But she hasn't come home--and I thought she would be"
"5472",140,"here the same as before."""
"5473",140,""
"5474",140,"""As before?"" echoed Jadvyga, in perplexity."

"5476",140,"""The time she spent the night here,"" said Jurgis."
"5477",140,""
"5478",140,"""There must be some mistake,"" she answered, quickly. ""Ona has never"
"5479",140,"spent the night here."""
"5480",140,""
"5481",140,"He was only half able to realize the words. ""Why--why--"" he exclaimed."

"5488",140,"He steadied himself by the door-sill; and Jadvyga in her anxiety--for"
"5489",140,"she was fond of Ona--opened the door wide, holding her jacket across"
"5490",140,"her throat. ""Are you sure you didn't misunderstand her?"" she cried. ""She"
"5491",140,"must have meant somewhere else. She--"""
"5492",140,""
"5493",140,"""She said here,"" insisted Jurgis. ""She told me all about you, and how"

"5495",140,"weren't away?"""

"5497",140,"""No, no!"" she exclaimed--and then came a peevish voice--""Jadvyga, you"
"5498",140,"are giving the baby a cold. Shut the door!"" Jurgis stood for half a"
"5499",140,"minute more, stammering his perplexity through an eighth of an inch of"
"5500",140,"crack; and then, as there was really nothing more to be said, he excused"
"5501",140,"himself and went away."
"5502",140,""
"5503",140,"He walked on half dazed, without knowing where he went. Ona had deceived"
"5504",140,"him! She had lied to him! And what could it mean--where had she been?"
"5505",140,"Where was she now? He could hardly grasp the thing--much less try to"
"5506",140,"solve it; but a hundred wild surmises came to him, a sense of impending"
"5507",140,"calamity overwhelmed him."
"5508",140,""
"5509",140,"Because there was nothing else to do, he went back to the time office to"
"5510",140,"watch again. He waited until nearly an hour after seven, and then went"
"5511",140,"to the room where Ona worked to make inquiries of Ona's ""forelady."" The"
"5512",140,"""forelady,"" he found, had not yet come; all the lines of cars that"
"5513",140,"came from downtown were stalled--there had been an accident in the"
"5514",140,"powerhouse, and no cars had been running since last night. Meantime,"
"5515",140,"however, the ham-wrappers were working away, with some one else in"
"5516",140,"charge of them. The girl who answered Jurgis was busy, and as she"
"5517",140,"talked she looked to see if she were being watched. Then a man came"
"5518",140,"up, wheeling a truck; he knew Jurgis for Ona's husband, and was curious"
"5519",140,"about the mystery."
"5520",140,""
"5521",140,"""Maybe the cars had something to do with it,"" he suggested--""maybe she"
"5522",140,"had gone down-town."""
"5523",140,""
"5524",140,"""No,"" said Jurgis, ""she never went down-town."""
"5525",140,""
"5526",140,"""Perhaps not,"" said the man. Jurgis thought he saw him exchange a swift"
"5527",140,"glance with the girl as he spoke, and he demanded quickly. ""What do you"
"5528",140,"know about it?"""
"5529",140,""
"5530",140,"But the man had seen that the boss was watching him; he started on"
"5531",140,"again, pushing his truck. ""I don't know anything about it,"" he said,"
"5532",140,"over his shoulder. ""How should I know where your wife goes?"""
"5533",140,""
"5534",140,"Then Jurgis went out again and paced up and down before the building."
"5535",140,"All the morning he stayed there, with no thought of his work. About"
"5536",140,"noon he went to the police station to make inquiries, and then came"
"5537",140,"back again for another anxious vigil. Finally, toward the middle of the"
"5538",140,"afternoon, he set out for home once more."
"5539",140,""
"5540",140,"He was walking out Ashland Avenue. The streetcars had begun running"
"5541",140,"again, and several passed him, packed to the steps with people. The"
"5542",140,"sight of them set Jurgis to thinking again of the man's sarcastic"
"5543",140,"remark; and half involuntarily he found himself watching the cars--with"
"5544",140,"the result that he gave a sudden startled exclamation, and stopped short"
"5545",140,"in his tracks."
"5546",140,""
"5547",140,"Then he broke into a run. For a whole block he tore after the car, only"
"5548",140,"a little ways behind. That rusty black hat with the drooping red flower,"
"5549",140,"it might not be Ona's, but there was very little likelihood of it."
"5550",140,"He would know for certain very soon, for she would get out two blocks"
"5551",140,"ahead. He slowed down, and let the car go on."
"5552",140,""
"5553",140,"She got out: and as soon as she was out of sight on the side street"
"5554",140,"Jurgis broke into a run. Suspicion was rife in him now, and he was not"
"5555",140,"ashamed to shadow her: he saw her turn the corner near their home, and"
"5556",140,"then he ran again, and saw her as she went up the porch steps of the"
"5557",140,"house. After that he turned back, and for five minutes paced up and"
"5558",140,"down, his hands clenched tightly and his lips set, his mind in a"
"5559",140,"turmoil. Then he went home and entered."
"5560",140,""
"5561",140,"As he opened the door, he saw Elzbieta, who had also been looking for"

"5565",140,"""Don't make any noise,"" she whispered, hurriedly."

"5570",140,"quiet."""
"5571",140,""
"5572",140,"""When did she come in?"" he asked."

"5592",140,"She had her hands clasped tightly in her lap, and he saw that her face"

"5595",140,"""Jurgis, I--I think I have been out of my mind. I started to come last"

"5621",140,"forward, stretching out her arms to him. But he stepped aside,"
"5622",140,"deliberately, and let her fall. She caught herself at the side of the"
"5623",140,"bed, and then sank down, burying her face in her hands and bursting into"
"5624",140,"frantic weeping."
"5625",140,""
"5626",140,"There came one of those hysterical crises that had so often dismayed"

"5629",140,"her, shaking her as the tempest shakes the trees upon the hills; all her"
"5630",140,"frame would quiver and throb with them--it was as if some dreadful thing"
"5631",140,"rose up within her and took possession of her, torturing her, tearing"
"5632",140,"her. This thing had been wont to set Jurgis quite beside himself; but"
"5633",140,"now he stood with his lips set tightly and his hands clenched--she might"
"5634",140,"weep till she killed herself, but she should not move him this time--not"
"5635",140,"an inch, not an inch. Because the sounds she made set his blood to"
"5636",140,"running cold and his lips to quivering in spite of himself, he was glad"
"5637",140,"of the diversion when Teta Elzbieta, pale with fright, opened the door"
"5638",140,"and rushed in; yet he turned upon her with an oath. ""Go out!"" he cried,"
"5639",140,"""go out!"" And then, as she stood hesitating, about to speak, he seized"
"5640",140,"her by the arm, and half flung her from the room, slamming the door"

"5647",140,"convulsive shudderings start in her body and run through her limbs. She"
"5648",140,"was sobbing and choking--it was as if there were too many sounds for one"
"5649",140,"throat, they came chasing each other, like waves upon the sea. Then her"
"5650",140,"voice would begin to rise into screams, louder and louder until it broke"

"5839",140,"will upon Ona, this great beast--and now he had it, he had it! It was"
"5840",140,"his turn now! Things swam blood before him, and he screamed aloud in his"

"5846",140,"interfere with him; it was only when half a dozen men had seized him by"
"5847",140,"the legs and shoulders and were pulling at him, that he understood that"
"5848",140,"he was losing his prey. In a flash he had bent down and sunk his teeth"
"5849",140,"into the man's cheek; and when they tore him away he was dripping with"

"5856",140,"mountain of twisted limbs and bodies, heaving and tossing, and working"
"5857",140,"its way about the room. In the end, by their sheer weight, they choked"
"5858",140,"the breath out of him, and then they carried him to the company police"

"5867",140,"When Jurgis got up again he went quietly enough. He was exhausted and"
"5868",140,"half-dazed, and besides he saw the blue uniforms of the policemen. He"
"5869",140,"drove in a patrol wagon with half a dozen of them watching him; keeping"
"5870",140,"as far away as possible, however, on account of the fertilizer. Then he"
"5871",140,"stood before the sergeant's desk and gave his name and address, and saw"
"5872",140,"a charge of assault and battery entered against him. On his way to his"
"5873",140,"cell a burly policeman cursed him because he started down the"
"5874",140,"wrong corridor, and then added a kick when he was not quick enough;"
"5875",140,"nevertheless, Jurgis did not even lift his eyes--he had lived two years"
"5876",140,"and a half in Packingtown, and he knew what the police were. It was as"
"5877",140,"much as a man's very life was worth to anger them, here in their inmost"
"5878",140,"lair; like as not a dozen would pile on to him at once, and pound"
"5879",140,"his face into a pulp. It would be nothing unusual if he got his skull"
"5880",140,"cracked in the melee--in which case they would report that he had"

"5887",140,""
"5888",140,"At first he was like a wild beast that has glutted itself; he was in"

"5891",140,"more, but pretty well, all the same; the ends of his fingers were still"
"5892",140,"tingling from their contact with the fellow's throat. But then, little"
"5893",140,"by little, as his strength came back and his senses cleared, he began"
"5894",140,"to see beyond his momentary gratification; that he had nearly killed"
"5895",140,"the boss would not help Ona--not the horrors that she had borne, nor the"
"5896",140,"memory that would haunt her all her days. It would not help to feed her"
"5897",140,"and her child; she would certainly lose her place, while he--what was to"
"5898",140,"happen to him God only knew."

"5900",140,"Half the night he paced the floor, wrestling with this nightmare; and"
"5901",140,"when he was exhausted he lay down, trying to sleep, but finding instead,"
"5902",140,"for the first time in his life, that his brain was too much for him. In"
"5903",140,"the cell next to him was a drunken wife-beater and in the one beyond"
"5904",140,"a yelling maniac. At midnight they opened the station house to the"
"5905",140,"homeless wanderers who were crowded about the door, shivering in the"
"5906",140,"winter blast, and they thronged into the corridor outside of the cells."
"5907",140,"Some of them stretched themselves out on the bare stone floor and fell"
"5908",140,"to snoring, others sat up, laughing and talking, cursing and quarreling."
"5909",140,"The air was fetid with their breath, yet in spite of this some of them"
"5910",140,"smelled Jurgis and called down the torments of hell upon him, while he"

"5916",140,"was drugged to keep the prisoners quiet. Jurgis had not known this, or"
"5917",140,"he would have swallowed the stuff in desperation; as it was, every nerve"
"5918",140,"of him was a-quiver with shame and rage. Toward morning the place fell"
"5919",140,"silent, and he got up and began to pace his cell; and then within the"
"5920",140,"soul of him there rose up a fiend, red-eyed and cruel, and tore out the"
"5921",140,"strings of his heart."
"5922",140,""
"5923",140,"It was not for himself that he suffered--what did a man who worked in"

"5926",140,"past, of the thing that had happened and could not be recalled, of the"
"5927",140,"memory that could never be effaced! The horror of it drove him mad;"
"5928",140,"he stretched out his arms to heaven, crying out for deliverance from"
"5929",140,"it--and there was no deliverance, there was no power even in heaven that"
"5930",140,"could undo the past. It was a ghost that would not drown; it followed"
"5931",140,"him, it seized upon him and beat him to the ground. Ah, if only he could"
"5932",140,"have foreseen it--but then, he would have foreseen it, if he had not"
"5933",140,"been a fool! He smote his hands upon his forehead, cursing himself"
"5934",140,"because he had ever allowed Ona to work where she had, because he had"
"5935",140,"not stood between her and a fate which every one knew to be so common."
"5936",140,"He should have taken her away, even if it were to lie down and die of"
"5937",140,"starvation in the gutters of Chicago's streets! And now--oh, it could"
"5938",140,"not be true; it was too monstrous, too horrible."
"5939",140,""
"5940",140,"It was a thing that could not be faced; a new shuddering seized him"
"5941",140,"every time he tried to think of it. No, there was no bearing the load of"
"5942",140,"it, there was no living under it. There would be none for her--he knew"
"5943",140,"that he might pardon her, might plead with her on his knees, but she"
"5944",140,"would never look him in the face again, she would never be his"
"5945",140,"wife again. The shame of it would kill her--there could be no other"
"5946",140,"deliverance, and it was best that she should die."
"5947",140,""
"5948",140,"This was simple and clear, and yet, with cruel inconsistency, whenever"
"5949",140,"he escaped from this nightmare it was to suffer and cry out at the"
"5950",140,"vision of Ona starving. They had put him in jail, and they would keep"
"5951",140,"him here a long time, years maybe. And Ona would surely not go to work"
"5952",140,"again, broken and crushed as she was. And Elzbieta and Marija, too,"
"5953",140,"might lose their places--if that hell fiend Connor chose to set to work"
"5954",140,"to ruin them, they would all be turned out. And even if he did not, they"
"5955",140,"could not live--even if the boys left school again, they could surely"
"5956",140,"not pay all the bills without him and Ona. They had only a few dollars"
"5957",140,"now--they had just paid the rent of the house a week ago, and that after"
"5958",140,"it was two weeks overdue. So it would be due again in a week! They would"
"5959",140,"have no money to pay it then--and they would lose the house, after all"
"5960",140,"their long, heartbreaking struggle. Three times now the agent had warned"
"5961",140,"him that he would not tolerate another delay. Perhaps it was very"
"5962",140,"base of Jurgis to be thinking about the house when he had the other"
"5963",140,"unspeakable thing to fill his mind; yet, how much he had suffered for"
"5964",140,"this house, how much they had all of them suffered! It was their one"
"5965",140,"hope of respite, as long as they lived; they had put all their money"
"5966",140,"into it--and they were working people, poor people, whose money was"

"5975",140,"the stores, and then be refused credit; they would borrow a little from"
"5976",140,"the Szedvilases, whose delicatessen store was tottering on the brink"

"5979",140,"were starving, and Tamoszius Kuszleika would bring them the proceeds of"
"5980",140,"a night's fiddling. So they would struggle to hang on until he got out"
"5981",140,"of jail--or would they know that he was in jail, would they be able to"
"5982",140,"find out anything about him? Would they be allowed to see him--or was it"
"5983",140,"to be part of his punishment to be kept in ignorance about their fate?"

"6016",140,"to talk, and had held two offices at once before he was old enough to"
"6017",140,"vote. If Scully was the thumb, Pat Callahan was the first finger of the"
"6018",140,"unseen hand whereby the packers held down the people of the district. No"

"6050",140,"cell doors of the inmates of the jail. This was a great event to the"
"6051",140,"latter--the daily review of the new arrivals, all stark naked, and many"

"6053",140,"longer than any one, in the vain hope of getting out of him a few of his"

"6057",140,"The cells were in tiers, opening upon galleries. His cell was about five"
"6058",140,"feet by seven in size, with a stone floor and a heavy wooden bench built"
"6059",140,"into it. There was no window--the only light came from windows near the"
"6060",140,"roof at one end of the court outside. There were two bunks, one above"
"6061",140,"the other, each with a straw mattress and a pair of gray blankets--the"
"6062",140,"latter stiff as boards with filth, and alive with fleas, bedbugs, and"
"6063",140,"lice. When Jurgis lifted up the mattress he discovered beneath it a"
"6064",140,"layer of scurrying roaches, almost as badly frightened as himself."
"6065",140,""
"6066",140,"Here they brought him more ""duffers and dope,"" with the addition of a"
"6067",140,"bowl of soup. Many of the prisoners had their meals brought in from a"
"6068",140,"restaurant, but Jurgis had no money for that. Some had books to read and"
"6069",140,"cards to play, with candles to burn by night, but Jurgis was all alone"
"6070",140,"in darkness and silence. He could not sleep again; there was the same"
"6071",140,"maddening procession of thoughts that lashed him like whips upon his"
"6072",140,"naked back. When night fell he was pacing up and down his cell like a"
"6073",140,"wild beast that breaks its teeth upon the bars of its cage. Now and then"
"6074",140,"in his frenzy he would fling himself against the walls of the place,"
"6075",140,"beating his hands upon them. They cut him and bruised him--they were"
"6076",140,"cold and merciless as the men who had built them."
"6077",140,""
"6078",140,"In the distance there was a church-tower bell that tolled the hours one"
"6079",140,"by one. When it came to midnight Jurgis was lying upon the floor with"
"6080",140,"his head in his arms, listening. Instead of falling silent at the end,"
"6081",140,"the bell broke into a sudden clangor. Jurgis raised his head; what could"
"6082",140,"that mean--a fire? God! Suppose there were to be a fire in this jail!"
"6083",140,"But then he made out a melody in the ringing; there were chimes. And"
"6084",140,"they seemed to waken the city--all around, far and near, there were"
"6085",140,"bells, ringing wild music; for fully a minute Jurgis lay lost in wonder,"
"6086",140,"before, all at once, the meaning of it broke over him--that this was"
"6087",140,"Christmas Eve!"
"6088",140,""
"6089",140,"Christmas Eve--he had forgotten it entirely! There was a breaking of"
"6090",140,"floodgates, a whirl of new memories and new griefs rushing into his"
"6091",140,"mind. In far Lithuania they had celebrated Christmas; and it came to"
"6092",140,"him as if it had been yesterday--himself a little child, with his lost"
"6093",140,"brother and his dead father in the cabin--in the deep black forest,"
"6094",140,"where the snow fell all day and all night and buried them from the"
"6095",140,"world. It was too far off for Santa Claus in Lithuania, but it was not"
"6096",140,"too far for peace and good will to men, for the wonder-bearing vision"
"6097",140,"of the Christ Child. And even in Packingtown they had not forgotten"
"6098",140,"it--some gleam of it had never failed to break their darkness. Last"
"6099",140,"Christmas Eve and all Christmas Day Jurgis had toiled on the killing"
"6100",140,"beds, and Ona at wrapping hams, and still they had found strength"
"6101",140,"enough to take the children for a walk upon the avenue, to see the store"
"6102",140,"windows all decorated with Christmas trees and ablaze with electric"
"6103",140,"lights. In one window there would be live geese, in another marvels in"
"6104",140,"sugar--pink and white canes big enough for ogres, and cakes with"
"6105",140,"cherubs upon them; in a third there would be rows of fat yellow turkeys,"
"6106",140,"decorated with rosettes, and rabbits and squirrels hanging; in a fourth"
"6107",140,"would be a fairyland of toys--lovely dolls with pink dresses, and woolly"
"6108",140,"sheep and drums and soldier hats. Nor did they have to go without their"
"6109",140,"share of all this, either. The last time they had had a big basket with"
"6110",140,"them and all their Christmas marketing to do--a roast of pork and a"
"6111",140,"cabbage and some rye bread, and a pair of mittens for Ona, and a rubber"
"6112",140,"doll that squeaked, and a little green cornucopia full of candy to be"

"6115",140,""
"6116",140,"Even half a year of the sausage machines and the fertilizer mill had not"

"6119",140,"home Teta Elzbieta had taken him aside and shown him an old valentine"
"6120",140,"that she had picked up in a paper store for three cents--dingy and"

"6122",140,"She had wiped all the specks off this, and was going to set it on the"
"6123",140,"mantel, where the children could see it. Great sobs shook Jurgis at this"
"6124",140,"memory--they would spend their Christmas in misery and despair, with"
"6125",140,"him in prison and Ona ill and their home in desolation. Ah, it was too"
"6126",140,"cruel! Why at least had they not left him alone--why, after they had"
"6127",140,"shut him in jail, must they be ringing Christmas chimes in his ears!"

"6129",140,"But no, their bells were not ringing for him--their Christmas was not"

"6131",140,"consequence--he was flung aside, like a bit of trash, the carcass of"
"6132",140,"some animal. It was horrible, horrible! His wife might be dying, his"
"6133",140,"baby might be starving, his whole family might be perishing in the"
"6134",140,"cold--and all the while they were ringing their Christmas chimes! And"
"6135",140,"the bitter mockery of it--all this was punishment for him! They put him"

"6320",140,"that dragged by, in which they had nothing to do but talk and nothing"
"6321",140,"to talk of but themselves. Jack Duane was from the East; he was a"
"6322",140,"college-bred man--had been studying electrical engineering. Then his"
"6323",140,"father had met with misfortune in business and killed himself; and there"
"6324",140,"had been his mother and a younger brother and sister. Also, there was an"
"6325",140,"invention of Duane's; Jurgis could not understand it clearly, but it had"
"6326",140,"to do with telegraphing, and it was a very important thing--there were"
"6327",140,"fortunes in it, millions upon millions of dollars. And Duane had been"
"6328",140,"robbed of it by a great company, and got tangled up in lawsuits and lost"
"6329",140,"all his money. Then somebody had given him a tip on a horse race, and he"
"6330",140,"had tried to retrieve his fortune with another person's money, and had"
"6331",140,"to run away, and all the rest had come from that. The other asked"
"6332",140,"him what had led him to safe-breaking--to Jurgis a wild and appalling"
"6333",140,"occupation to think about. A man he had met, his cell mate had"
"6334",140,"replied--one thing leads to another. Didn't he ever wonder about his"
"6335",140,"family, Jurgis asked. Sometimes, the other answered, but not often--he"
"6336",140,"didn't allow it. Thinking about it would make it no better. This wasn't"
"6337",140,"a world in which a man had any business with a family; sooner or later"

"6359",140,"innocent men too poor to give bail; old men, and boys literally not yet"
"6360",140,"in their teens. They were the drainage of the great festering ulcer of"

"6367",140,"a city in which justice and honor, women's bodies and men's souls, were"
"6368",140,"for sale in the marketplace, and human beings writhed and fought and"
"6369",140,"fell upon each other like wolves in a pit; in which lusts were raging"
"6370",140,"fires, and men were fuel, and humanity was festering and stewing and"

"6381",140,"their savage mockery; and all the while his heart was far away, where"
"6382",140,"his loved ones were calling. Now and then in the midst of it his"
"6383",140,"thoughts would take flight; and then the tears would come into his"

"6387",140,"He spent a week in this company, and during all that time he had no word"

"6389",140,"his companion wrote a note to the family, telling them where he was"
"6390",140,"and when he would be tried. There came no answer to it, however, and at"
"6391",140,"last, the day before New Year's, Jurgis bade good-by to Jack Duane. The"
"6392",140,"latter gave him his address, or rather the address of his mistress, and"

"6402",140,"pen and sat gazing at them in helpless agony. He saw that Ona was not"
"6403",140,"with them, and was full of foreboding as to what that might mean. He"
"6404",140,"spent half an hour brooding over this--and then suddenly he straightened"

"6406",140,"not see his features for the bandages that swathed him, but he knew the"
"6407",140,"burly figure. It was Connor! A trembling seized him, and his limbs bent"
"6408",140,"as if for a spring. Then suddenly he felt a hand on his collar, and"
"6409",140,"heard a voice behind him: ""Sit down, you son of a--!"""

"6498",140,"This time Jurgis was bound for the ""Bridewell,"" a petty jail where Cook"
"6499",140,"County prisoners serve their time. It was even filthier and more crowded"

"6501",140,"sifted into it--the petty thieves and swindlers, the brawlers and"
"6502",140,"vagrants. For his cell mate Jurgis had an Italian fruit seller who"
"6503",140,"had refused to pay his graft to the policeman, and been arrested for"
"6504",140,"carrying a large pocketknife; as he did not understand a word of English"
"6505",140,"our friend was glad when he left. He gave place to a Norwegian sailor,"

"6520",140,"started up, and he saw that it was little Stanislovas. At the sight"
"6521",140,"of some one from home the big fellow nearly went to pieces--he had to"
"6522",140,"steady himself by a chair, and he put his other hand to his forehead, as"

"6564",140,"had to beat him to send him to work. Now he clenched his hands, looking"
"6565",140,"as if he would try to break through the grating. ""You little villain,"""

"6618",140,"agony, and cannot lift his hand, nor cry out, but feels that he is going"

"6701",140,"Jurgis hesitated a moment, nonplussed. Then he said, ""I mean which is"
"6702",140,"the way?"""
"6703",140,""
"6704",140,"""Why don't yer say so then?"" was the response, and the boy pointed to"
"6705",140,"the northwest, across the tracks. ""That way."""
"6706",140,""
"6707",140,"""How far is it?"" Jurgis asked. ""I dunno,"" said the other. ""Mebbe twenty"
"6708",140,"miles or so."""
"6709",140,""
"6710",140,"""Twenty miles!"" Jurgis echoed, and his face fell. He had to walk every"
"6711",140,"foot of it, for they had turned him out of jail without a penny in his"
"6712",140,"pockets."
"6713",140,""
"6714",140,"Yet, when he once got started, and his blood had warmed with walking,"
"6715",140,"he forgot everything in the fever of his thoughts. All the dreadful"
"6716",140,"imaginations that had haunted him in his cell now rushed into his mind"
"6717",140,"at once. The agony was almost over--he was going to find out; and he"
"6718",140,"clenched his hands in his pockets as he strode, following his flying"
"6719",140,"desire, almost at a run. Ona--the baby--the family--the house--he would"
"6720",140,"know the truth about them all! And he was coming to the rescue--he was"
"6721",140,"free again! His hands were his own, and he could help them, he could do"
"6722",140,"battle for them against the world."
"6723",140,""
"6724",140,"For an hour or so he walked thus, and then he began to look about him."
"6725",140,"He seemed to be leaving the city altogether. The street was turning into"
"6726",140,"a country road, leading out to the westward; there were snow-covered"
"6727",140,"fields on either side of him. Soon he met a farmer driving a two-horse"
"6728",140,"wagon loaded with straw, and he stopped him."
"6729",140,""
"6730",140,"""Is this the way to the stockyards?"" he asked."
"6731",140,""
"6732",140,"The farmer scratched his head. ""I dunno jest where they be,"" he said."
"6733",140,"""But they're in the city somewhere, and you're going dead away from it"
"6734",140,"now."""
"6735",140,""
"6736",140,"Jurgis looked dazed. ""I was told this was the way,"" he said."
"6737",140,""
"6738",140,"""Who told you?"""
"6739",140,""
"6740",140,"""A boy."""
"6741",140,""
"6742",140,"""Well, mebbe he was playing a joke on ye. The best thing ye kin do is to"
"6743",140,"go back, and when ye git into town ask a policeman. I'd take ye in, only"
"6744",140,"I've come a long ways an' I'm loaded heavy. Git up!"""
"6745",140,""
"6746",140,"So Jurgis turned and followed, and toward the end of the morning he"
"6747",140,"began to see Chicago again. Past endless blocks of two-story shanties"
"6748",140,"he walked, along wooden sidewalks and unpaved pathways treacherous with"
"6749",140,"deep slush holes. Every few blocks there would be a railroad crossing"
"6750",140,"on the level with the sidewalk, a deathtrap for the unwary; long freight"
"6751",140,"trains would be passing, the cars clanking and crashing together, and"
"6752",140,"Jurgis would pace about waiting, burning up with a fever of impatience."
"6753",140,"Occasionally the cars would stop for some minutes, and wagons and"
"6754",140,"streetcars would crowd together waiting, the drivers swearing at each"
"6755",140,"other, or hiding beneath umbrellas out of the rain; at such times Jurgis"
"6756",140,"would dodge under the gates and run across the tracks and between the"
"6757",140,"cars, taking his life into his hands."
"6758",140,""
"6759",140,"He crossed a long bridge over a river frozen solid and covered with"
"6760",140,"slush. Not even on the river bank was the snow white--the rain which"
"6761",140,"fell was a diluted solution of smoke, and Jurgis' hands and face were"
"6762",140,"streaked with black. Then he came into the business part of the city,"
"6763",140,"where the streets were sewers of inky blackness, with horses sleeping"
"6764",140,"and plunging, and women and children flying across in panic-stricken"
"6765",140,"droves. These streets were huge canyons formed by towering black"
"6766",140,"buildings, echoing with the clang of car gongs and the shouts of"
"6767",140,"drivers; the people who swarmed in them were as busy as ants--all"
"6768",140,"hurrying breathlessly, never stopping to look at anything nor at each"
"6769",140,"other. The solitary trampish-looking foreigner, with water-soaked"
"6770",140,"clothing and haggard face and anxious eyes, was as much alone as he"
"6771",140,"hurried past them, as much unheeded and as lost, as if he had been a"
"6772",140,"thousand miles deep in a wilderness."
"6773",140,""
"6774",140,"A policeman gave him his direction and told him that he had five miles"
"6775",140,"to go. He came again to the slum districts, to avenues of saloons and"
"6776",140,"cheap stores, with long dingy red factory buildings, and coal-yards and"
"6777",140,"railroad tracks; and then Jurgis lifted up his head and began to sniff"
"6778",140,"the air like a startled animal--scenting the far-off odor of home. It"
"6779",140,"was late afternoon then, and he was hungry, but the dinner invitations"
"6780",140,"hung out of the saloons were not for him."
"6781",140,""
"6782",140,"So he came at last to the stockyards, to the black volcanoes of smoke"
"6783",140,"and the lowing cattle and the stench. Then, seeing a crowded car, his"
"6784",140,"impatience got the better of him and he jumped aboard, hiding behind"
"6785",140,"another man, unnoticed by the conductor. In ten minutes more he had"
"6786",140,"reached his street, and home."
"6787",140,""
"6788",140,"He was half running as he came round the corner. There was the house, at"
"6789",140,"any rate--and then suddenly he stopped and stared. What was the matter"
"6790",140,"with the house?"
"6791",140,""
"6792",140,"Jurgis looked twice, bewildered; then he glanced at the house next door"
"6793",140,"and at the one beyond--then at the saloon on the corner. Yes, it was"
"6794",140,"the right place, quite certainly--he had not made any mistake. But the"
"6795",140,"house--the house was a different color!"
"6796",140,""
"6797",140,"He came a couple of steps nearer. Yes; it had been gray and now it was"
"6798",140,"yellow! The trimmings around the windows had been red, and now they were"
"6799",140,"green! It was all newly painted! How strange it made it seem!"
"6800",140,""
"6801",140,"Jurgis went closer yet, but keeping on the other side of the street."
"6802",140,"A sudden and horrible spasm of fear had come over him. His knees were"
"6803",140,"shaking beneath him, and his mind was in a whirl. New paint on the"
"6804",140,"house, and new weatherboards, where the old had begun to rot off, and"
"6805",140,"the agent had got after them! New shingles over the hole in the roof,"
"6806",140,"too, the hole that had for six months been the bane of his soul--he"
"6807",140,"having no money to have it fixed and no time to fix it himself, and the"
"6808",140,"rain leaking in, and overflowing the pots and pans he put to catch it,"
"6809",140,"and flooding the attic and loosening the plaster. And now it was fixed!"
"6810",140,"And the broken windowpane replaced! And curtains in the windows! New,"
"6811",140,"white curtains, stiff and shiny!"
"6812",140,""
"6813",140,"Then suddenly the front door opened. Jurgis stood, his chest heaving as"
"6814",140,"he struggled to catch his breath. A boy had come out, a stranger to him;"
"6815",140,"a big, fat, rosy-cheeked youngster, such as had never been seen in his"
"6816",140,"home before."
"6817",140,""
"6818",140,"Jurgis stared at the boy, fascinated. He came down the steps whistling,"
"6819",140,"kicking off the snow. He stopped at the foot, and picked up some, and"
"6820",140,"then leaned against the railing, making a snowball. A moment later"
"6821",140,"he looked around and saw Jurgis, and their eyes met; it was a hostile"
"6822",140,"glance, the boy evidently thinking that the other had suspicions of the"
"6823",140,"snowball. When Jurgis started slowly across the street toward him, he"
"6824",140,"gave a quick glance about, meditating retreat, but then he concluded to"
"6825",140,"stand his ground."
"6826",140,""
"6827",140,"Jurgis took hold of the railing of the steps, for he was a little"
"6828",140,"unsteady. ""What--what are you doing here?"" he managed to gasp."
"6829",140,""
"6830",140,"""Go on!"" said the boy."
"6831",140,""
"6832",140,"""You--"" Jurgis tried again. ""What do you want here?"""
"6833",140,""
"6834",140,"""Me?"" answered the boy, angrily. ""I live here."""
"6835",140,""
"6836",140,"""You live here!"" Jurgis panted. He turned white and clung more tightly"
"6837",140,"to the railing. ""You live here! Then where's my family?"""
"6838",140,""
"6839",140,"The boy looked surprised. ""Your family!"" he echoed."
"6840",140,""
"6841",140,"And Jurgis started toward him. ""I--this is my house!"" he cried."
"6842",140,""
"6843",140,"""Come off!"" said the boy; then suddenly the door upstairs opened, and he"
"6844",140,"called: ""Hey, ma! Here's a fellow says he owns this house."""
"6845",140,""
"6846",140,"A stout Irishwoman came to the top of the steps. ""What's that?"" she"
"6847",140,"demanded."
"6848",140,""
"6849",140,"Jurgis turned toward her. ""Where is my family?"" he cried, wildly. ""I"
"6850",140,"left them here! This is my home! What are you doing in my home?"""
"6851",140,""
"6852",140,"The woman stared at him in frightened wonder, she must have thought"
"6853",140,"she was dealing with a maniac--Jurgis looked like one. ""Your home!"" she"
"6854",140,"echoed."
"6855",140,""
"6856",140,"""My home!"" he half shrieked. ""I lived here, I tell you."""
"6857",140,""
"6858",140,"""You must be mistaken,"" she answered him. ""No one ever lived here. This"
"6859",140,"is a new house. They told us so. They--"""
"6860",140,""
"6861",140,"""What have they done with my family?"" shouted Jurgis, frantically."
"6862",140,""
"6863",140,"A light had begun to break upon the woman; perhaps she had had doubts of"
"6864",140,"what ""they"" had told her. ""I don't know where your family is,"" she said."
"6865",140,"""I bought the house only three days ago, and there was nobody here, and"
"6866",140,"they told me it was all new. Do you really mean you had ever rented it?"""
"6867",140,""
"6868",140,"""Rented it!"" panted Jurgis. ""I bought it! I paid for it! I own it! And"
"6869",140,"they--my God, can't you tell me where my people went?"""
"6870",140,""
"6871",140,"She made him understand at last that she knew nothing. Jurgis' brain"
"6872",140,"was so confused that he could not grasp the situation. It was as if his"
"6873",140,"family had been wiped out of existence; as if they were proving to be"
"6874",140,"dream people, who never had existed at all. He was quite lost--but then"
"6875",140,"suddenly he thought of Grandmother Majauszkiene, who lived in the next"
"6876",140,"block. She would know! He turned and started at a run."
"6877",140,""
"6878",140,"Grandmother Majauszkiene came to the door herself. She cried out when"
"6879",140,"she saw Jurgis, wild-eyed and shaking. Yes, yes, she could tell him. The"
"6880",140,"family had moved; they had not been able to pay the rent and they had"
"6881",140,"been turned out into the snow, and the house had been repainted and sold"
"6882",140,"again the next week. No, she had not heard how they were, but she could"
"6883",140,"tell him that they had gone back to Aniele Jukniene, with whom they had"
"6884",140,"stayed when they first came to the yards. Wouldn't Jurgis come in and"
"6885",140,"rest? It was certainly too bad--if only he had not got into jail--"
"6886",140,""
"6887",140,"And so Jurgis turned and staggered away. He did not go very far round"
"6888",140,"the corner he gave out completely, and sat down on the steps of a"
"6889",140,"saloon, and hid his face in his hands, and shook all over with dry,"
"6890",140,"racking sobs."
"6891",140,""
"6892",140,"Their home! Their home! They had lost it! Grief, despair, rage,"
"6893",140,"overwhelmed him--what was any imagination of the thing to this"
"6894",140,"heartbreaking, crushing reality of it--to the sight of strange people"
"6895",140,"living in his house, hanging their curtains to his windows, staring at"
"6896",140,"him with hostile eyes! It was monstrous, it was unthinkable--they could"
"6897",140,"not do it--it could not be true! Only think what he had suffered for"
"6898",140,"that house--what miseries they had all suffered for it--the price they"
"6899",140,"had paid for it!"
"6900",140,""
"6901",140,"The whole long agony came back to him. Their sacrifices in the"
"6902",140,"beginning, their three hundred dollars that they had scraped together,"
"6903",140,"all they owned in the world, all that stood between them and starvation!"
"6904",140,"And then their toil, month by month, to get together the twelve dollars,"
"6905",140,"and the interest as well, and now and then the taxes, and the other"
"6906",140,"charges, and the repairs, and what not! Why, they had put their very"
"6907",140,"souls into their payments on that house, they had paid for it with their"
"6908",140,"sweat and tears--yes, more, with their very lifeblood. Dede Antanas had"
"6909",140,"died of the struggle to earn that money--he would have been alive and"
"6910",140,"strong today if he had not had to work in Durham's dark cellars to earn"
"6911",140,"his share. And Ona, too, had given her health and strength to pay for"
"6912",140,"it--she was wrecked and ruined because of it; and so was he, who had"
"6913",140,"been a big, strong man three years ago, and now sat here shivering,"
"6914",140,"broken, cowed, weeping like a hysterical child. Ah! they had cast their"
"6915",140,"all into the fight; and they had lost, they had lost! All that they had"
"6916",140,"paid was gone--every cent of it. And their house was gone--they were"
"6917",140,"back where they had started from, flung out into the cold to starve and"
"6918",140,"freeze!"
"6919",140,""
"6920",140,"Jurgis could see all the truth now--could see himself, through the whole"
"6921",140,"long course of events, the victim of ravenous vultures that had torn"
"6922",140,"into his vitals and devoured him; of fiends that had racked and tortured"
"6923",140,"him, mocking him, meantime, jeering in his face. Ah, God, the horror"
"6924",140,"of it, the monstrous, hideous, demoniacal wickedness of it! He and his"
"6925",140,"family, helpless women and children, struggling to live, ignorant and"
"6926",140,"defenseless and forlorn as they were--and the enemies that had been"
"6927",140,"lurking for them, crouching upon their trail and thirsting for their"
"6928",140,"blood! That first lying circular, that smooth-tongued slippery agent!"
"6929",140,"That trap of the extra payments, the interest, and all the other charges"
"6930",140,"that they had not the means to pay, and would never have attempted to"
"6931",140,"pay! And then all the tricks of the packers, their masters, the tyrants"
"6932",140,"who ruled them--the shutdowns and the scarcity of work, the irregular"
"6933",140,"hours and the cruel speeding-up, the lowering of wages, the raising of"
"6934",140,"prices! The mercilessness of nature about them, of heat and cold, rain"
"6935",140,"and snow; the mercilessness of the city, of the country in which they"
"6936",140,"lived, of its laws and customs that they did not understand! All of"
"6937",140,"these things had worked together for the company that had marked them"
"6938",140,"for its prey and was waiting for its chance. And now, with this last"
"6939",140,"hideous injustice, its time had come, and it had turned them out bag"
"6940",140,"and baggage, and taken their house and sold it again! And they could"
"6941",140,"do nothing, they were tied hand and foot--the law was against them, the"
"6942",140,"whole machinery of society was at their oppressors' command! If Jurgis"
"6943",140,"so much as raised a hand against them, back he would go into that"
"6944",140,"wild-beast pen from which he had just escaped!"
"6945",140,""
"6946",140,"To get up and go away was to give up, to acknowledge defeat, to leave"
"6947",140,"the strange family in possession; and Jurgis might have sat shivering"
"6948",140,"in the rain for hours before he could do that, had it not been for"
"6949",140,"the thought of his family. It might be that he had worse things yet to"
"6950",140,"learn--and so he got to his feet and started away, walking on, wearily,"
"6951",140,"half-dazed."
"6952",140,""
"6953",140,"To Aniele's house, in back of the yards, was a good two miles; the"
"6954",140,"distance had never seemed longer to Jurgis, and when he saw the familiar"
"6955",140,"dingy-gray shanty his heart was beating fast. He ran up the steps and"
"6956",140,"began to hammer upon the door."
"6957",140,""
"6958",140,"The old woman herself came to open it. She had shrunk all up with her"
"6959",140,"rheumatism since Jurgis had seen her last, and her yellow parchment face"
"6960",140,"stared up at him from a little above the level of the doorknob. She gave"
"6961",140,"a start when she saw him. ""Is Ona here?"" he cried, breathlessly."
"6962",140,""
"6963",140,"""Yes,"" was the answer, ""she's here."""
"6964",140,""
"6965",140,"""How--"" Jurgis began, and then stopped short, clutching convulsively at"
"6966",140,"the side of the door. From somewhere within the house had come a sudden"
"6967",140,"cry, a wild, horrible scream of anguish. And the voice was Ona's. For a"
"6968",140,"moment Jurgis stood half-paralyzed with fright; then he bounded past the"
"6969",140,"old woman and into the room."
"6970",140,""
"6971",140,"It was Aniele's kitchen, and huddled round the stove were half a dozen"

"6974",140,"bandages--he hardly realized that it was Marija. He looked first for"
"6975",140,"Ona; then, not seeing her, he stared at the women, expecting them to"
"6976",140,"speak. But they sat dumb, gazing back at him, panic-stricken; and a"
"6977",140,"second later came another piercing scream."
"6978",140,""
"6979",140,"It was from the rear of the house, and upstairs. Jurgis bounded to a"

"6982",140,"heard a voice behind him, and saw Marija at his heels. She seized him by"

"7349",140,"So Jurgis spent the night. The whisky had only half warmed him, and he"
"7350",140,"could not sleep, exhausted as he was; he would nod forward, and then"
"7351",140,"start up, shivering with the cold, and begin to remember again. Hour"
"7352",140,"after hour passed, until he could only persuade himself that it was not"
"7353",140,"morning by the sounds of music and laughter and singing that were to"
"7354",140,"be heard from the room. When at last these ceased, he expected that he"
"7355",140,"would be turned out into the street; as this did not happen, he fell to"
"7356",140,"wondering whether the man had forgotten him."
"7357",140,""
"7358",140,"In the end, when the silence and suspense were no longer to be borne,"
"7359",140,"he got up and hammered on the door; and the proprietor came, yawning"
"7360",140,"and rubbing his eyes. He was keeping open all night, and dozing between"
"7361",140,"customers."
"7362",140,""
"7363",140,"""I want to go home,"" Jurgis said. ""I'm worried about my wife--I can't"
"7364",140,"wait any longer."""
"7365",140,""
"7366",140,"""Why the hell didn't you say so before?"" said the man. ""I thought you"
"7367",140,"didn't have any home to go to."" Jurgis went outside. It was four o'clock"
"7368",140,"in the morning, and as black as night. There were three or four inches"
"7369",140,"of fresh snow on the ground, and the flakes were falling thick and fast."
"7370",140,"He turned toward Aniele's and started at a run."
"7371",140,""
"7372",140,""
"7373",140,"There was a light burning in the kitchen window and the blinds were"
"7374",140,"drawn. The door was unlocked and Jurgis rushed in."
"7375",140,""
"7376",140,"Aniele, Marija, and the rest of the women were huddled about the"
"7377",140,"stove, exactly as before; with them were several newcomers, Jurgis"
"7378",140,"noticed--also he noticed that the house was silent."
"7379",140,""
"7380",140,"""Well?"" he said."
"7381",140,""
"7382",140,"No one answered him, they sat staring at him with their pale faces. He"
"7383",140,"cried again: ""Well?"""
"7384",140,""
"7385",140,"And then, by the light of the smoky lamp, he saw Marija who sat nearest"
"7386",140,"him, shaking her head slowly. ""Not yet,"" she said."
"7387",140,""
"7388",140,"And Jurgis gave a cry of dismay. ""Not yet?"""
"7389",140,""
"7390",140,"Again Marija's head shook. The poor fellow stood dumfounded. ""I don't"
"7391",140,"hear her,"" he gasped."
"7392",140,""
"7393",140,"""She's been quiet a long time,"" replied the other."
"7394",140,""
"7395",140,"There was another pause--broken suddenly by a voice from the attic:"
"7396",140,"""Hello, there!"""
"7397",140,""
"7398",140,"Several of the women ran into the next room, while Marija sprang toward"
"7399",140,"Jurgis. ""Wait here!"" she cried, and the two stood, pale and trembling,"
"7400",140,"listening. In a few moments it became clear that Madame Haupt was"
"7401",140,"engaged in descending the ladder, scolding and exhorting again, while"
"7402",140,"the ladder creaked in protest. In a moment or two she reached the"
"7403",140,"ground, angry and breathless, and they heard her coming into the room."
"7404",140,"Jurgis gave one glance at her, and then turned white and reeled. She had"
"7405",140,"her jacket off, like one of the workers on the killing beds. Her hands"
"7406",140,"and arms were smeared with blood, and blood was splashed upon her"
"7407",140,"clothing and her face."
"7408",140,""
"7409",140,"She stood breathing hard, and gazing about her; no one made a sound. ""I"
"7410",140,"haf done my best,"" she began suddenly. ""I can do noffing more--dere is"
"7411",140,"no use to try."""
"7412",140,""
"7413",140,"Again there was silence."
"7414",140,""
"7415",140,"""It ain't my fault,"" she said. ""You had ought to haf had a doctor, und"
"7416",140,"not vaited so long--it vas too late already ven I come."" Once more there"
"7417",140,"was deathlike stillness. Marija was clutching Jurgis with all the power"
"7418",140,"of her one well arm."
"7419",140,""
"7420",140,"Then suddenly Madame Haupt turned to Aniele. ""You haf not got something"
"7421",140,"to drink, hey?"" she queried. ""Some brandy?"""
"7422",140,""
"7423",140,"Aniele shook her head."
"7424",140,""
"7425",140,"""Herr Gott!"" exclaimed Madame Haupt. ""Such people! Perhaps you vill give"
"7426",140,"me someting to eat den--I haf had noffing since yesterday morning, und"

"7429",140,"moment she chanced to look round, and saw Jurgis: She shook her finger"

"7435",140,"mine own pockets."""
"7436",140,""
"7437",140,"Here Madame Haupt paused for a moment to get her breath; and Marija,"
"7438",140,"seeing the beads of sweat on Jurgis's forehead, and feeling the"
"7439",140,"quivering of his frame, broke out in a low voice: ""How is Ona?"""
"7440",140,""
"7441",140,"""How is she?"" echoed Madame Haupt. ""How do you tink she can be ven"
"7442",140,"you leave her to kill herself so? I told dem dot ven they send for de"
"7443",140,"priest. She is young, und she might haf got over it, und been vell und"
"7444",140,"strong, if she had been treated right. She fight hard, dot girl--she is"
"7445",140,"not yet quite dead."""
"7446",140,""
"7447",140,"And Jurgis gave a frantic scream. ""Dead!"""
"7448",140,""
"7449",140,"""She vill die, of course,"" said the other angrily. ""Der baby is dead"
"7450",140,"now."""
"7451",140,""
"7452",140,"The garret was lighted by a candle stuck upon a board; it had almost"
"7453",140,"burned itself out, and was sputtering and smoking as Jurgis rushed up"
"7454",140,"the ladder. He could make out dimly in one corner a pallet of rags and"
"7455",140,"old blankets, spread upon the floor; at the foot of it was a crucifix,"
"7456",140,"and near it a priest muttering a prayer. In a far corner crouched"
"7457",140,"Elzbieta, moaning and wailing. Upon the pallet lay Ona."
"7458",140,""
"7459",140,"She was covered with a blanket, but he could see her shoulders and"
"7460",140,"one arm lying bare; she was so shrunken he would scarcely have known"
"7461",140,"her--she was all but a skeleton, and as white as a piece of chalk. Her"
"7462",140,"eyelids were closed, and she lay still as death. He staggered toward her"
"7463",140,"and fell upon his knees with a cry of anguish: ""Ona! Ona!"""
"7464",140,""
"7465",140,"She did not stir. He caught her hand in his, and began to clasp"
"7466",140,"it frantically, calling: ""Look at me! Answer me! It is Jurgis come"
"7467",140,"back--don't you hear me?"""
"7468",140,""
"7469",140,"There was the faintest quivering of the eyelids, and he called again in"
"7470",140,"frenzy: ""Ona! Ona!"""
"7471",140,""
"7472",140,"Then suddenly her eyes opened one instant. One instant she looked at"
"7473",140,"him--there was a flash of recognition between them, he saw her afar off,"
"7474",140,"as through a dim vista, standing forlorn. He stretched out his arms to"
"7475",140,"her, he called her in wild despair; a fearful yearning surged up in him,"
"7476",140,"hunger for her that was agony, desire that was a new being born"
"7477",140,"within him, tearing his heartstrings, torturing him. But it was all in"
"7478",140,"vain--she faded from him, she slipped back and was gone. And a wail of"
"7479",140,"anguish burst from him, great sobs shook all his frame, and hot tears"
"7480",140,"ran down his cheeks and fell upon her. He clutched her hands, he shook"
"7481",140,"her, he caught her in his arms and pressed her to him but she lay cold"
"7482",140,"and still--she was gone--she was gone!"
"7483",140,""
"7484",140,"The word rang through him like the sound of a bell, echoing in the far"
"7485",140,"depths of him, making forgotten chords to vibrate, old shadowy fears to"
"7486",140,"stir--fears of the dark, fears of the void, fears of annihilation. She"
"7487",140,"was dead! She was dead! He would never see her again, never hear her"
"7488",140,"again! An icy horror of loneliness seized him; he saw himself standing"
"7489",140,"apart and watching all the world fade away from him--a world of shadows,"
"7490",140,"of fickle dreams. He was like a little child, in his fright and grief;"
"7491",140,"he called and called, and got no answer, and his cries of despair echoed"
"7492",140,"through the house, making the women downstairs draw nearer to each other"
"7493",140,"in fear. He was inconsolable, beside himself--the priest came and laid"
"7494",140,"his hand upon his shoulder and whispered to him, but he heard not a"
"7495",140,"sound. He was gone away himself, stumbling through the shadows, and"
"7496",140,"groping after the soul that had fled."
"7497",140,""
"7498",140,""
"7499",140,"So he lay. The gray dawn came up and crept into the attic. The"
"7500",140,"priest left, the women left, and he was alone with the still, white"
"7501",140,"figure--quieter now, but moaning and shuddering, wrestling with the"
"7502",140,"grisly fiend. Now and then he would raise himself and stare at the white"
"7503",140,"mask before him, then hide his eyes because he could not bear it. Dead!"
"7504",140,"dead! And she was only a girl, she was barely eighteen! Her life had"
"7505",140,"hardly begun--and here she lay murdered--mangled, tortured to death!"
"7506",140,""
"7507",140,"It was morning when he rose up and came down into the kitchen--haggard"
"7508",140,"and ashen gray, reeling and dazed. More of the neighbors had come in,"
"7509",140,"and they stared at him in silence as he sank down upon a chair by the"
"7510",140,"table and buried his face in his arms."
"7511",140,""
"7512",140,"A few minutes later the front door opened; a blast of cold and snow"
"7513",140,"rushed in, and behind it little Kotrina, breathless from running, and"
"7514",140,"blue with the cold. ""I'm home again!"" she exclaimed. ""I could hardly--"""
"7515",140,""
"7516",140,"And then, seeing Jurgis, she stopped with an exclamation. Looking from"
"7517",140,"one to another she saw that something had happened, and she asked, in a"
"7518",140,"lower voice: ""What's the matter?"""
"7519",140,""
"7520",140,"Before anyone could reply, Jurgis started up; he went toward her,"
"7521",140,"walking unsteadily. ""Where have you been?"" he demanded."
"7522",140,""
"7523",140,"""Selling papers with the boys,"" she said. ""The snow--"""
"7524",140,""
"7525",140,"""Have you any money?"" he demanded."
"7526",140,""
"7527",140,"""Yes."""
"7528",140,""
"7529",140,"""How much?"""
"7530",140,""
"7531",140,"""Nearly three dollars, Jurgis."""
"7532",140,""
"7533",140,"""Give it to me."""
"7534",140,""
"7535",140,"Kotrina, frightened by his manner, glanced at the others. ""Give it to"
"7536",140,"me!"" he commanded again, and she put her hand into her pocket and pulled"
"7537",140,"out a lump of coins tied in a bit of rag. Jurgis took it without a word,"
"7538",140,"and went out of the door and down the street."
"7539",140,""
"7540",140,"Three doors away was a saloon. ""Whisky,"" he said, as he entered, and as"
"7541",140,"the man pushed him some, he tore at the rag with his teeth and pulled"
"7542",140,"out half a dollar. ""How much is the bottle?"" he said. ""I want to get"
"7543",140,"drunk."""
"7544",140,""

"7546",140,""
"7547",140,"Chapter 20"
"7548",140,""
"7549",140,""
"7550",140,"But a big man cannot stay drunk very long on three dollars. That was"
"7551",140,"Sunday morning, and Monday night Jurgis came home, sober and sick,"
"7552",140,"realizing that he had spent every cent the family owned, and had not"
"7553",140,"bought a single instant's forgetfulness with it."
"7554",140,""
"7555",140,"Ona was not yet buried; but the police had been notified, and on the"
"7556",140,"morrow they would put the body in a pine coffin and take it to the"
"7557",140,"potter's field. Elzbieta was out begging now, a few pennies from each of"
"7558",140,"the neighbors, to get enough to pay for a mass for her; and the children"
"7559",140,"were upstairs starving to death, while he, good-for-nothing rascal, had"
"7560",140,"been spending their money on drink. So spoke Aniele, scornfully, and"
"7561",140,"when he started toward the fire she added the information that her"
"7562",140,"kitchen was no longer for him to fill with his phosphate stinks. She"
"7563",140,"had crowded all her boarders into one room on Ona's account, but now he"
"7564",140,"could go up in the garret where he belonged--and not there much longer,"
"7565",140,"either, if he did not pay her some rent."
"7566",140,""
"7567",140,"Jurgis went without a word, and, stepping over half a dozen sleeping"
"7568",140,"boarders in the next room, ascended the ladder. It was dark up above;"
"7569",140,"they could not afford any light; also it was nearly as cold as outdoors."
"7570",140,"In a corner, as far away from the corpse as possible, sat Marija,"
"7571",140,"holding little Antanas in her one good arm and trying to soothe him to"
"7572",140,"sleep. In another corner crouched poor little Juozapas, wailing because"
"7573",140,"he had had nothing to eat all day. Marija said not a word to Jurgis; he"
"7574",140,"crept in like a whipped cur, and went and sat down by the body."
"7575",140,""
"7576",140,"Perhaps he ought to have meditated upon the hunger of the children, and"
"7577",140,"upon his own baseness; but he thought only of Ona, he gave himself up"
"7578",140,"again to the luxury of grief. He shed no tears, being ashamed to make a"
"7579",140,"sound; he sat motionless and shuddering with his anguish. He had never"
"7580",140,"dreamed how much he loved Ona, until now that she was gone; until now"
"7581",140,"that he sat here, knowing that on the morrow they would take her away,"
"7582",140,"and that he would never lay eyes upon her again--never all the days"
"7583",140,"of his life. His old love, which had been starved to death, beaten to"
"7584",140,"death, awoke in him again; the floodgates of memory were lifted--he saw"
"7585",140,"all their life together, saw her as he had seen her in Lithuania, the"
"7586",140,"first day at the fair, beautiful as the flowers, singing like a bird. He"
"7587",140,"saw her as he had married her, with all her tenderness, with her heart"
"7588",140,"of wonder; the very words she had spoken seemed to ring now in his ears,"
"7589",140,"the tears she had shed to be wet upon his cheek. The long, cruel battle"
"7590",140,"with misery and hunger had hardened and embittered him, but it had not"
"7591",140,"changed her--she had been the same hungry soul to the end, stretching"
"7592",140,"out her arms to him, pleading with him, begging him for love and"
"7593",140,"tenderness. And she had suffered--so cruelly she had suffered, such"
"7594",140,"agonies, such infamies--ah, God, the memory of them was not to be borne."
"7595",140,"What a monster of wickedness, of heartlessness, he had been! Every angry"
"7596",140,"word that he had ever spoken came back to him and cut him like a knife;"
"7597",140,"every selfish act that he had done--with what torments he paid for them"
"7598",140,"now! And such devotion and awe as welled up in his soul--now that it"
"7599",140,"could never be spoken, now that it was too late, too late! His bosom-was"
"7600",140,"choking with it, bursting with it; he crouched here in the darkness"
"7601",140,"beside her, stretching out his arms to her--and she was gone forever,"
"7602",140,"she was dead! He could have screamed aloud with the horror and despair"
"7603",140,"of it; a sweat of agony beaded his forehead, yet he dared not make a"
"7604",140,"sound--he scarcely dared to breathe, because of his shame and loathing"
"7605",140,"of himself."
"7606",140,""
"7607",140,"Late at night came Elzbieta, having gotten the money for a mass, and"
"7608",140,"paid for it in advance, lest she should be tempted too sorely at home."
"7609",140,"She brought also a bit of stale rye bread that some one had given her,"
"7610",140,"and with that they quieted the children and got them to sleep. Then she"
"7611",140,"came over to Jurgis and sat down beside him."
"7612",140,""
"7613",140,"She said not a word of reproach--she and Marija had chosen that course"
"7614",140,"before; she would only plead with him, here by the corpse of his dead"
"7615",140,"wife. Already Elzbieta had choked down her tears, grief being crowded"
"7616",140,"out of her soul by fear. She had to bury one of her children--but then"
"7617",140,"she had done it three times before, and each time risen up and gone back"
"7618",140,"to take up the battle for the rest. Elzbieta was one of the primitive"
"7619",140,"creatures: like the angleworm, which goes on living though cut in half;"
"7620",140,"like a hen, which, deprived of her chickens one by one, will mother the"
"7621",140,"last that is left her. She did this because it was her nature--she asked"
"7622",140,"no questions about the justice of it, nor the worth-whileness of life in"
"7623",140,"which destruction and death ran riot."
"7624",140,""
"7625",140,"And this old common-sense view she labored to impress upon Jurgis,"
"7626",140,"pleading with him with tears in her eyes. Ona was dead, but the others"
"7627",140,"were left and they must be saved. She did not ask for her own children."
"7628",140,"She and Marija could care for them somehow, but there was Antanas, his"
"7629",140,"own son. Ona had given Antanas to him--the little fellow was the only"
"7630",140,"remembrance of her that he had; he must treasure it and protect it, he"
"7631",140,"must show himself a man. He knew what Ona would have had him do, what"
"7632",140,"she would ask of him at this moment, if she could speak to him. It was"
"7633",140,"a terrible thing that she should have died as she had; but the life had"
"7634",140,"been too hard for her, and she had to go. It was terrible that they"
"7635",140,"were not able to bury her, that he could not even have a day to mourn"
"7636",140,"her--but so it was. Their fate was pressing; they had not a cent, and"
"7637",140,"the children would perish--some money must be had. Could he not be a man"
"7638",140,"for Ona's sake, and pull himself together? In a little while they would"
"7639",140,"be out of danger--now that they had given up the house they could live"
"7640",140,"more cheaply, and with all the children working they could get along,"
"7641",140,"if only he would not go to pieces. So Elzbieta went on, with feverish"
"7642",140,"intensity. It was a struggle for life with her; she was not afraid that"
"7643",140,"Jurgis would go on drinking, for he had no money for that, but she was"
"7644",140,"wild with dread at the thought that he might desert them, might take to"
"7645",140,"the road, as Jonas had done."
"7646",140,""
"7647",140,"But with Ona's dead body beneath his eyes, Jurgis could not well think"
"7648",140,"of treason to his child. Yes, he said, he would try, for the sake of"
"7649",140,"Antanas. He would give the little fellow his chance--would get to work"
"7650",140,"at once, yes, tomorrow, without even waiting for Ona to be buried. They"
"7651",140,"might trust him, he would keep his word, come what might."
"7652",140,""
"7653",140,"And so he was out before daylight the next morning, headache, heartache,"
"7654",140,"and all. He went straight to Graham's fertilizer mill, to see if he"
"7655",140,"could get back his job. But the boss shook his head when he saw him--no,"
"7656",140,"his place had been filled long ago, and there was no room for him."
"7657",140,""
"7658",140,"""Do you think there will be?"" Jurgis asked. ""I may have to wait."""
"7659",140,""
"7660",140,"""No,"" said the other, ""it will not be worth your while to wait--there"
"7661",140,"will be nothing for you here."""
"7662",140,""
"7663",140,"Jurgis stood gazing at him in perplexity. ""What is the matter?"" he"
"7664",140,"asked. ""Didn't I do my work?"""
"7665",140,""
"7666",140,"The other met his look with one of cold indifference, and answered,"
"7667",140,"""There will be nothing for you here, I said."""

"7669",140,"Jurgis had his suspicions as to the dreadful meaning of that incident,"

"7671",140,"with the mob of hungry wretches who were standing about in the snow"
"7672",140,"before the time station. Here he stayed, breakfastless, for two hours,"
"7673",140,"until the throng was driven away by the clubs of the police. There was"

"7678",140,"sandwich, and members of his old union who would lend him a dime at a"
"7679",140,"pinch. It was not a question of life and death for him, therefore; he"
"7680",140,"might hunt all day, and come again on the morrow, and try hanging on"
"7681",140,"thus for weeks, like hundreds and thousands of others. Meantime, Teta"
"7682",140,"Elzbieta would go and beg, over in the Hyde Park district, and the"
"7683",140,"children would bring home enough to pacify Aniele, and keep them all"

"7686",140,"It was at the end of a week of this sort of waiting, roaming about in"
"7687",140,"the bitter winds or loafing in saloons, that Jurgis stumbled on a chance"
"7688",140,"in one of the cellars of Jones's big packing plant. He saw a foreman"
"7689",140,"passing the open doorway, and hailed him for a job."

"7737",140,"he might have known! Why, he stood as much chance of getting a job in"
"7738",140,"Packingtown as of being chosen mayor of Chicago. Why had he wasted his"
"7739",140,"time hunting? They had him on a secret list in every office, big and"
"7740",140,"little, in the place. They had his name by this time in St. Louis and"
"7741",140,"New York, in Omaha and Boston, in Kansas City and St. Joseph. He was"
"7742",140,"condemned and sentenced, without trial and without appeal; he could"
"7743",140,"never work for the packers again--he could not even clean cattle pens or"
"7744",140,"drive a truck in any place where they controlled. He might try it, if he"
"7745",140,"chose, as hundreds had tried it, and found out for themselves. He"
"7746",140,"would never be told anything about it; he would never get any more"
"7747",140,"satisfaction than he had gotten just now; but he would always find when"
"7748",140,"the time came that he was not needed. It would not do for him to give"
"7749",140,"any other name, either--they had company ""spotters"" for just that"
"7750",140,"purpose, and he wouldn't keep a job in Packingtown three days. It was"
"7751",140,"worth a fortune to the packers to keep their blacklist effective, as"

"7753",140,"political discontent."

"7755",140,"Jurgis went home, carrying these new tidings to the family council. It"
"7756",140,"was a most cruel thing; here in this district was his home, such as it"
"7757",140,"was, the place he was used to and the friends he knew--and now every"
"7758",140,"possibility of employment in it was closed to him. There was nothing in"
"7759",140,"Packingtown but packing houses; and so it was the same thing as evicting"
"7760",140,"him from his home."
"7761",140,""
"7762",140,"He and the two women spent all day and half the night discussing it. It"
"7763",140,"would be convenient, downtown, to the children's place of work; but then"
"7764",140,"Marija was on the road to recovery, and had hopes of getting a job in"
"7765",140,"the yards; and though she did not see her old-time lover once a month,"
"7766",140,"because of the misery of their state, yet she could not make up her"
"7767",140,"mind to go away and give him up forever. Then, too, Elzbieta had heard"
"7768",140,"something about a chance to scrub floors in Durham's offices and was"
"7769",140,"waiting every day for word. In the end it was decided that Jurgis should"
"7770",140,"go downtown to strike out for himself, and they would decide after he"
"7771",140,"got a job. As there was no one from whom he could borrow there, and he"
"7772",140,"dared not beg for fear of being arrested, it was arranged that every day"
"7773",140,"he should meet one of the children and be given fifteen cents of their"
"7774",140,"earnings, upon which he could keep going. Then all day he was to pace"
"7775",140,"the streets with hundreds and thousands of other homeless wretches"
"7776",140,"inquiring at stores, warehouses, and factories for a chance; and at"
"7777",140,"night he was to crawl into some doorway or underneath a truck, and hide"
"7778",140,"there until midnight, when he might get into one of the station houses,"
"7779",140,"and spread a newspaper upon the floor, and lie down in the midst of"
"7780",140,"a throng of ""bums"" and beggars, reeking with alcohol and tobacco, and"
"7781",140,"filthy with vermin and disease."
"7782",140,""
"7783",140,""
"7784",140,"So for two weeks more Jurgis fought with the demon of despair. Once he"
"7785",140,"got a chance to load a truck for half a day, and again he carried an old"
"7786",140,"woman's valise and was given a quarter. This let him into a lodging-house"
"7787",140,"on several nights when he might otherwise have frozen to death; and it"
"7788",140,"also gave him a chance now and then to buy a newspaper in the morning"
"7789",140,"and hunt up jobs while his rivals were watching and waiting for a"
"7790",140,"paper to be thrown away. This, however, was really not the advantage it"
"7791",140,"seemed, for the newspaper advertisements were a cause of much loss of"
"7792",140,"precious time and of many weary journeys. A full half of these were"
"7793",140,"""fakes,"" put in by the endless variety of establishments which preyed"
"7794",140,"upon the helpless ignorance of the unemployed. If Jurgis lost only"
"7795",140,"his time, it was because he had nothing else to lose; whenever a"
"7796",140,"smooth-tongued agent would tell him of the wonderful positions he had on"
"7797",140,"hand, he could only shake his head sorrowfully and say that he had not"
"7798",140,"the necessary dollar to deposit; when it was explained to him what ""big"
"7799",140,"money"" he and all his family could make by coloring photographs, he"
"7800",140,"could only promise to come in again when he had two dollars to invest in"
"7801",140,"the outfit."
"7802",140,""
"7803",140,"In the end Jurgis got a chance through an accidental meeting with an"
"7804",140,"old-time acquaintance of his union days. He met this man on his way to"
"7805",140,"work in the giant factories of the Harvester Trust; and his friend told"
"7806",140,"him to come along and he would speak a good word for him to his boss,"
"7807",140,"whom he knew well. So Jurgis trudged four or five miles, and passed"
"7808",140,"through a waiting throng of unemployed at the gate under the escort"
"7809",140,"of his friend. His knees nearly gave way beneath him when the foreman,"
"7810",140,"after looking him over and questioning him, told him that he could find"
"7811",140,"an opening for him."
"7812",140,""
"7813",140,"How much this accident meant to Jurgis he realized only by stages;"
"7814",140,"for he found that the harvester works were the sort of place to which"
"7815",140,"philanthropists and reformers pointed with pride. It had some thought"
"7816",140,"for its employees; its workshops were big and roomy, it provided a"
"7817",140,"restaurant where the workmen could buy good food at cost, it had even"
"7818",140,"a reading room, and decent places where its girl-hands could rest; also"
"7819",140,"the work was free from many of the elements of filth and repulsiveness"
"7820",140,"that prevailed at the stockyards. Day after day Jurgis discovered these"
"7821",140,"things--things never expected nor dreamed of by him--until this new"
"7822",140,"place came to seem a kind of a heaven to him."
"7823",140,""
"7824",140,"It was an enormous establishment, covering a hundred and sixty acres"
"7825",140,"of ground, employing five thousand people, and turning out over three"
"7826",140,"hundred thousand machines every year--a good part of all the harvesting"
"7827",140,"and mowing machines used in the country. Jurgis saw very little of it,"
"7828",140,"of course--it was all specialized work, the same as at the stockyards;"
"7829",140,"each one of the hundreds of parts of a mowing machine was made"
"7830",140,"separately, and sometimes handled by hundreds of men. Where Jurgis"
"7831",140,"worked there was a machine which cut and stamped a certain piece of"
"7832",140,"steel about two square inches in size; the pieces came tumbling out upon"
"7833",140,"a tray, and all that human hands had to do was to pile them in regular"
"7834",140,"rows, and change the trays at intervals. This was done by a single boy,"
"7835",140,"who stood with eyes and thought centered upon it, and fingers flying so"
"7836",140,"fast that the sounds of the bits of steel striking upon each other was"
"7837",140,"like the music of an express train as one hears it in a sleeping car at"
"7838",140,"night. This was ""piece-work,"" of course; and besides it was made certain"
"7839",140,"that the boy did not idle, by setting the machine to match the highest"
"7840",140,"possible speed of human hands. Thirty thousand of these pieces he"
"7841",140,"handled every day, nine or ten million every year--how many in a"
"7842",140,"lifetime it rested with the gods to say. Near by him men sat bending"
"7843",140,"over whirling grindstones, putting the finishing touches to the steel"
"7844",140,"knives of the reaper; picking them out of a basket with the right hand,"
"7845",140,"pressing first one side and then the other against the stone and finally"
"7846",140,"dropping them with the left hand into another basket. One of these men"
"7847",140,"told Jurgis that he had sharpened three thousand pieces of steel a day"
"7848",140,"for thirteen years. In the next room were wonderful machines that ate"
"7849",140,"up long steel rods by slow stages, cutting them off, seizing the pieces,"
"7850",140,"stamping heads upon them, grinding them and polishing them, threading"
"7851",140,"them, and finally dropping them into a basket, all ready to bolt the"
"7852",140,"harvesters together. From yet another machine came tens of thousands of"
"7853",140,"steel burs to fit upon these bolts. In other places all these various"
"7854",140,"parts were dipped into troughs of paint and hung up to dry, and then"
"7855",140,"slid along on trolleys to a room where men streaked them with red and"
"7856",140,"yellow, so that they might look cheerful in the harvest fields."
"7857",140,""
"7858",140,"Jurgis's friend worked upstairs in the casting rooms, and his task was"
"7859",140,"to make the molds of a certain part. He shoveled black sand into an"
"7860",140,"iron receptacle and pounded it tight and set it aside to harden; then it"
"7861",140,"would be taken out, and molten iron poured into it. This man, too, was"
"7862",140,"paid by the mold--or rather for perfect castings, nearly half his"
"7863",140,"work going for naught. You might see him, along with dozens of others,"
"7864",140,"toiling like one possessed by a whole community of demons; his arms"
"7865",140,"working like the driving rods of an engine, his long, black hair flying"
"7866",140,"wild, his eyes starting out, the sweat rolling in rivers down his face."
"7867",140,"When he had shoveled the mold full of sand, and reached for the pounder"
"7868",140,"to pound it with, it was after the manner of a canoeist running rapids"
"7869",140,"and seizing a pole at sight of a submerged rock. All day long this man"
"7870",140,"would toil thus, his whole being centered upon the purpose of making"
"7871",140,"twenty-three instead of twenty-two and a half cents an hour; and then"
"7872",140,"his product would be reckoned up by the census taker, and jubilant"
"7873",140,"captains of industry would boast of it in their banquet halls, telling"
"7874",140,"how our workers are nearly twice as efficient as those of any other"
"7875",140,"country. If we are the greatest nation the sun ever shone upon, it would"
"7876",140,"seem to be mainly because we have been able to goad our wage-earners to"
"7877",140,"this pitch of frenzy; though there are a few other things that are great"
"7878",140,"among us including our drink-bill, which is a billion and a quarter of"
"7879",140,"dollars a year, and doubling itself every decade."
"7880",140,""
"7881",140,""
"7882",140,"There was a machine which stamped out the iron plates, and then another"
"7883",140,"which, with a mighty thud, mashed them to the shape of the sitting-down"
"7884",140,"portion of the American farmer. Then they were piled upon a truck, and"
"7885",140,"it was Jurgis's task to wheel them to the room where the machines were"
"7886",140,"""assembled."" This was child's play for him, and he got a dollar"
"7887",140,"and seventy-five cents a day for it; on Saturday he paid Aniele the"
"7888",140,"seventy-five cents a week he owed her for the use of her garret, and"
"7889",140,"also redeemed his overcoat, which Elzbieta had put in pawn when he was"
"7890",140,"in jail."
"7891",140,""
"7892",140,"This last was a great blessing. A man cannot go about in midwinter in"
"7893",140,"Chicago with no overcoat and not pay for it, and Jurgis had to walk or"
"7894",140,"ride five or six miles back and forth to his work. It so happened that"
"7895",140,"half of this was in one direction and half in another, necessitating"
"7896",140,"a change of cars; the law required that transfers be given at all"
"7897",140,"intersecting points, but the railway corporation had gotten round this"
"7898",140,"by arranging a pretense at separate ownership. So whenever he wished"
"7899",140,"to ride, he had to pay ten cents each way, or over ten per cent of his"
"7900",140,"income to this power, which had gotten its franchises long ago by buying"
"7901",140,"up the city council, in the face of popular clamor amounting almost to a"
"7902",140,"rebellion. Tired as he felt at night, and dark and bitter cold as it"
"7903",140,"was in the morning, Jurgis generally chose to walk; at the hours other"
"7904",140,"workmen were traveling, the streetcar monopoly saw fit to put on so few"
"7905",140,"cars that there would be men hanging to every foot of the backs of them"
"7906",140,"and often crouching upon the snow-covered roof. Of course the doors"
"7907",140,"could never be closed, and so the cars were as cold as outdoors; Jurgis,"
"7908",140,"like many others, found it better to spend his fare for a drink and a"
"7909",140,"free lunch, to give him strength to walk."
"7910",140,""
"7911",140,"These, however, were all slight matters to a man who had escaped from"
"7912",140,"Durham's fertilizer mill. Jurgis began to pick up heart again and to"
"7913",140,"make plans. He had lost his house but then the awful load of the rent"
"7914",140,"and interest was off his shoulders, and when Marija was well again they"
"7915",140,"could start over and save. In the shop where he worked was a man, a"
"7916",140,"Lithuanian like himself, whom the others spoke of in admiring whispers,"
"7917",140,"because of the mighty feats he was performing. All day he sat at a"
"7918",140,"machine turning bolts; and then in the evening he went to the public"
"7919",140,"school to study English and learn to read. In addition, because he had a"
"7920",140,"family of eight children to support and his earnings were not enough, on"
"7921",140,"Saturdays and Sundays he served as a watchman; he was required to press"
"7922",140,"two buttons at opposite ends of a building every five minutes, and"
"7923",140,"as the walk only took him two minutes, he had three minutes to study"
"7924",140,"between each trip. Jurgis felt jealous of this fellow; for that was"
"7925",140,"the sort of thing he himself had dreamed of, two or three years ago."
"7926",140,"He might do it even yet, if he had a fair chance--he might attract"
"7927",140,"attention and become a skilled man or a boss, as some had done in this"
"7928",140,"place. Suppose that Marija could get a job in the big mill where they"
"7929",140,"made binder twine--then they would move into this neighborhood, and he"
"7930",140,"would really have a chance. With a hope like that, there was some use"
"7931",140,"in living; to find a place where you were treated like a human being--by"
"7932",140,"God! he would show them how he could appreciate it. He laughed to"
"7933",140,"himself as he thought how he would hang on to this job!"
"7934",140,""
"7935",140,"And then one afternoon, the ninth of his work in the place, when he went"
"7936",140,"to get his overcoat he saw a group of men crowded before a placard on"

"7975",140,""
"7976",140,"For another ten days he roamed the streets and alleys of the huge city,"

"7986",140,"police station, and slept down in a corridor, crowded with two other men"
"7987",140,"upon a single step."
"7988",140,""
"7989",140,"He had to fight often in these days to fight for a place near the"
"7990",140,"factory gates, and now and again with gangs on the street. He found, for"
"7991",140,"instance, that the business of carrying satchels for railroad passengers"
"7992",140,"was a pre-empted one--whenever he essayed it, eight or ten men and boys"
"7993",140,"would fall upon him and force him to run for his life. They always"
"7994",140,"had the policeman ""squared,"" and so there was no use in expecting"
"7995",140,"protection."
"7996",140,""
"7997",140,"That Jurgis did not starve to death was due solely to the pittance the"
"7998",140,"children brought him. And even this was never certain. For one thing the"
"7999",140,"cold was almost more than the children could bear; and then they, too,"
"8000",140,"were in perpetual peril from rivals who plundered and beat them. The law"
"8001",140,"was against them, too--little Vilimas, who was really eleven, but did"
"8002",140,"not look to be eight, was stopped on the streets by a severe old lady in"
"8003",140,"spectacles, who told him that he was too young to be working and that"
"8004",140,"if he did not stop selling papers she would send a truant officer after"
"8005",140,"him. Also one night a strange man caught little Kotrina by the arm and"
"8006",140,"tried to persuade her into a dark cellar-way, an experience which filled"
"8007",140,"her with such terror that she was hardly to be kept at work."
"8008",140,""
"8009",140,"At last, on a Sunday, as there was no use looking for work, Jurgis went"
"8010",140,"home by stealing rides on the cars. He found that they had been waiting"
"8011",140,"for him for three days--there was a chance of a job for him."
"8012",140,""
"8013",140,"It was quite a story. Little Juozapas, who was near crazy with hunger"
"8014",140,"these days, had gone out on the street to beg for himself. Juozapas had"
"8015",140,"only one leg, having been run over by a wagon when a little child,"
"8016",140,"but he had got himself a broomstick, which he put under his arm for a"
"8017",140,"crutch. He had fallen in with some other children and found the way to"
"8018",140,"Mike Scully's dump, which lay three or four blocks away. To this place"
"8019",140,"there came every day many hundreds of wagon-loads of garbage and trash"
"8020",140,"from the lake front, where the rich people lived; and in the heaps the"
"8021",140,"children raked for food--there were hunks of bread and potato peelings"
"8022",140,"and apple cores and meat bones, all of it half frozen and quite"
"8023",140,"unspoiled. Little Juozapas gorged himself, and came home with a"
"8024",140,"newspaper full, which he was feeding to Antanas when his mother came in."
"8025",140,"Elzbieta was horrified, for she did not believe that the food out of the"
"8026",140,"dumps was fit to eat. The next day, however, when no harm came of it and"
"8027",140,"Juozapas began to cry with hunger, she gave in and said that he might go"
"8028",140,"again. And that afternoon he came home with a story of how while he had"
"8029",140,"been digging away with a stick, a lady upon the street had called him."
"8030",140,"A real fine lady, the little boy explained, a beautiful lady; and"
"8031",140,"she wanted to know all about him, and whether he got the garbage for"
"8032",140,"chickens, and why he walked with a broomstick, and why Ona had died, and"
"8033",140,"how Jurgis had come to go to jail, and what was the matter with Marija,"
"8034",140,"and everything. In the end she had asked where he lived, and said that"
"8035",140,"she was coming to see him, and bring him a new crutch to walk with. She"
"8036",140,"had on a hat with a bird upon it, Juozapas added, and a long fur snake"
"8037",140,"around her neck."
"8038",140,""
"8039",140,"She really came, the very next morning, and climbed the ladder to the"
"8040",140,"garret, and stood and stared about her, turning pale at the sight of"
"8041",140,"the blood stains on the floor where Ona had died. She was a ""settlement"
"8042",140,"worker,"" she explained to Elzbieta--she lived around on Ashland Avenue."
"8043",140,"Elzbieta knew the place, over a feed store; somebody had wanted her to"
"8044",140,"go there, but she had not cared to, for she thought that it must have"
"8045",140,"something to do with religion, and the priest did not like her to have"
"8046",140,"anything to do with strange religions. They were rich people who came"
"8047",140,"to live there to find out about the poor people; but what good they"
"8048",140,"expected it would do them to know, one could not imagine. So spoke"
"8049",140,"Elzbieta, naively, and the young lady laughed and was rather at a loss"
"8050",140,"for an answer--she stood and gazed about her, and thought of a cynical"
"8051",140,"remark that had been made to her, that she was standing upon the brink"
"8052",140,"of the pit of hell and throwing in snowballs to lower the temperature."
"8053",140,""
"8054",140,"Elzbieta was glad to have somebody to listen, and she told all their"
"8055",140,"woes--what had happened to Ona, and the jail, and the loss of their"
"8056",140,"home, and Marija's accident, and how Ona had died, and how Jurgis could"
"8057",140,"get no work. As she listened the pretty young lady's eyes filled with"
"8058",140,"tears, and in the midst of it she burst into weeping and hid her face on"
"8059",140,"Elzbieta's shoulder, quite regardless of the fact that the woman had on"
"8060",140,"a dirty old wrapper and that the garret was full of fleas. Poor Elzbieta"
"8061",140,"was ashamed of herself for having told so woeful a tale, and the other"
"8062",140,"had to beg and plead with her to get her to go on. The end of it was"
"8063",140,"that the young lady sent them a basket of things to eat, and left a"
"8064",140,"letter that Jurgis was to take to a gentleman who was superintendent in"
"8065",140,"one of the mills of the great steelworks in South Chicago. ""He will get"
"8066",140,"Jurgis something to do,"" the young lady had said, and added, smiling"
"8067",140,"through her tears--""If he doesn't, he will never marry me."""
"8068",140,""
"8069",140,"The steel-works were fifteen miles away, and as usual it was so"
"8070",140,"contrived that one had to pay two fares to get there. Far and wide the"
"8071",140,"sky was flaring with the red glare that leaped from rows of towering"
"8072",140,"chimneys--for it was pitch dark when Jurgis arrived. The vast works, a"
"8073",140,"city in themselves, were surrounded by a stockade; and already a full"
"8074",140,"hundred men were waiting at the gate where new hands were taken on. Soon"
"8075",140,"after daybreak whistles began to blow, and then suddenly thousands of"
"8076",140,"men appeared, streaming from saloons and boardinghouses across the way,"
"8077",140,"leaping from trolley cars that passed--it seemed as if they rose out of"
"8078",140,"the ground, in the dim gray light. A river of them poured in through the"
"8079",140,"gate--and then gradually ebbed away again, until there were only a few"
"8080",140,"late ones running, and the watchman pacing up and down, and the hungry"
"8081",140,"strangers stamping and shivering."
"8082",140,""
"8083",140,"Jurgis presented his precious letter. The gatekeeper was surly, and put"
"8084",140,"him through a catechism, but he insisted that he knew nothing, and as he"
"8085",140,"had taken the precaution to seal his letter, there was nothing for the"
"8086",140,"gatekeeper to do but send it to the person to whom it was addressed."
"8087",140,"A messenger came back to say that Jurgis should wait, and so he came"
"8088",140,"inside of the gate, perhaps not sorry enough that there were others less"
"8089",140,"fortunate watching him with greedy eyes. The great mills were getting"
"8090",140,"under way--one could hear a vast stirring, a rolling and rumbling"
"8091",140,"and hammering. Little by little the scene grew plain: towering, black"
"8092",140,"buildings here and there, long rows of shops and sheds, little railways"
"8093",140,"branching everywhere, bare gray cinders underfoot and oceans of"
"8094",140,"billowing black smoke above. On one side of the grounds ran a railroad"
"8095",140,"with a dozen tracks, and on the other side lay the lake, where steamers"
"8096",140,"came to load."
"8097",140,""
"8098",140,"Jurgis had time enough to stare and speculate, for it was two hours"
"8099",140,"before he was summoned. He went into the office building, where a"
"8100",140,"company timekeeper interviewed him. The superintendent was busy, he"
"8101",140,"said, but he (the timekeeper) would try to find Jurgis a job. He had"
"8102",140,"never worked in a steel mill before? But he was ready for anything?"
"8103",140,"Well, then, they would go and see."
"8104",140,""
"8105",140,"So they began a tour, among sights that made Jurgis stare amazed. He"
"8106",140,"wondered if ever he could get used to working in a place like this,"
"8107",140,"where the air shook with deafening thunder, and whistles shrieked"
"8108",140,"warnings on all sides of him at once; where miniature steam engines came"
"8109",140,"rushing upon him, and sizzling, quivering, white-hot masses of metal"
"8110",140,"sped past him, and explosions of fire and flaming sparks dazzled him and"
"8111",140,"scorched his face. The men in these mills were all black with soot, and"
"8112",140,"hollow-eyed and gaunt; they worked with fierce intensity, rushing here"
"8113",140,"and there, and never lifting their eyes from their tasks. Jurgis clung"
"8114",140,"to his guide like a scared child to its nurse, and while the latter"
"8115",140,"hailed one foreman after another to ask if they could use another"
"8116",140,"unskilled man, he stared about him and marveled."
"8117",140,""
"8118",140,"He was taken to the Bessemer furnace, where they made billets of"
"8119",140,"steel--a dome-like building, the size of a big theater. Jurgis stood"
"8120",140,"where the balcony of the theater would have been, and opposite, by the"
"8121",140,"stage, he saw three giant caldrons, big enough for all the devils of"
"8122",140,"hell to brew their broth in, full of something white and blinding,"
"8123",140,"bubbling and splashing, roaring as if volcanoes were blowing through"
"8124",140,"it--one had to shout to be heard in the place. Liquid fire would leap"
"8125",140,"from these caldrons and scatter like bombs below--and men were working"
"8126",140,"there, seeming careless, so that Jurgis caught his breath with fright."
"8127",140,"Then a whistle would toot, and across the curtain of the theater would"
"8128",140,"come a little engine with a carload of something to be dumped into one"
"8129",140,"of the receptacles; and then another whistle would toot, down by"
"8130",140,"the stage, and another train would back up--and suddenly, without an"
"8131",140,"instant's warning, one of the giant kettles began to tilt and topple,"
"8132",140,"flinging out a jet of hissing, roaring flame. Jurgis shrank back"
"8133",140,"appalled, for he thought it was an accident; there fell a pillar of"
"8134",140,"white flame, dazzling as the sun, swishing like a huge tree falling in"
"8135",140,"the forest. A torrent of sparks swept all the way across the building,"
"8136",140,"overwhelming everything, hiding it from sight; and then Jurgis looked"
"8137",140,"through the fingers of his hands, and saw pouring out of the caldron a"
"8138",140,"cascade of living, leaping fire, white with a whiteness not of earth,"
"8139",140,"scorching the eyeballs. Incandescent rainbows shone above it, blue,"
"8140",140,"red, and golden lights played about it; but the stream itself was white,"
"8141",140,"ineffable. Out of regions of wonder it streamed, the very river of life;"
"8142",140,"and the soul leaped up at the sight of it, fled back upon it, swift and"
"8143",140,"resistless, back into far-off lands, where beauty and terror dwell. Then"
"8144",140,"the great caldron tilted back again, empty, and Jurgis saw to his relief"
"8145",140,"that no one was hurt, and turned and followed his guide out into the"
"8146",140,"sunlight."
"8147",140,""
"8148",140,"They went through the blast furnaces, through rolling mills where bars"
"8149",140,"of steel were tossed about and chopped like bits of cheese. All around"
"8150",140,"and above giant machine arms were flying, giant wheels were turning,"
"8151",140,"great hammers crashing; traveling cranes creaked and groaned overhead,"
"8152",140,"reaching down iron hands and seizing iron prey--it was like standing in"
"8153",140,"the center of the earth, where the machinery of time was revolving."
"8154",140,""
"8155",140,"By and by they came to the place where steel rails were made; and Jurgis"
"8156",140,"heard a toot behind him, and jumped out of the way of a car with a"
"8157",140,"white-hot ingot upon it, the size of a man's body. There was a sudden"
"8158",140,"crash and the car came to a halt, and the ingot toppled out upon"
"8159",140,"a moving platform, where steel fingers and arms seized hold of it,"
"8160",140,"punching it and prodding it into place, and hurrying it into the grip of"
"8161",140,"huge rollers. Then it came out upon the other side, and there were more"
"8162",140,"crashings and clatterings, and over it was flopped, like a pancake on"
"8163",140,"a gridiron, and seized again and rushed back at you through another"
"8164",140,"squeezer. So amid deafening uproar it clattered to and fro, growing"
"8165",140,"thinner and flatter and longer. The ingot seemed almost a living thing;"
"8166",140,"it did not want to run this mad course, but it was in the grip of fate,"
"8167",140,"it was tumbled on, screeching and clanking and shivering in protest. By"
"8168",140,"and by it was long and thin, a great red snake escaped from purgatory;"
"8169",140,"and then, as it slid through the rollers, you would have sworn that it"
"8170",140,"was alive--it writhed and squirmed, and wriggles and shudders passed out"
"8171",140,"through its tail, all but flinging it off by their violence. There was"
"8172",140,"no rest for it until it was cold and black--and then it needed only to"
"8173",140,"be cut and straightened to be ready for a railroad."
"8174",140,""
"8175",140,"It was at the end of this rail's progress that Jurgis got his chance."
"8176",140,"They had to be moved by men with crowbars, and the boss here could use"
"8177",140,"another man. So he took off his coat and set to work on the spot."
"8178",140,""
"8179",140,""
"8180",140,"It took him two hours to get to this place every day and cost him a"
"8181",140,"dollar and twenty cents a week. As this was out of the question, he"
"8182",140,"wrapped his bedding in a bundle and took it with him, and one of his"
"8183",140,"fellow workingmen introduced him to a Polish lodging-house, where he"
"8184",140,"might have the privilege of sleeping upon the floor for ten cents a"
"8185",140,"night. He got his meals at free-lunch counters, and every Saturday night"
"8186",140,"he went home--bedding and all--and took the greater part of his money to"
"8187",140,"the family. Elzbieta was sorry for this arrangement, for she feared that"
"8188",140,"it would get him into the habit of living without them, and once a week"
"8189",140,"was not very often for him to see his baby; but there was no other way"
"8190",140,"of arranging it. There was no chance for a woman at the steelworks, and"
"8191",140,"Marija was now ready for work again, and lured on from day to day by the"
"8192",140,"hope of finding it at the yards."
"8193",140,""
"8194",140,""
"8195",140,"In a week Jurgis got over his sense of helplessness and bewilderment"
"8196",140,"in the rail mill. He learned to find his way about and to take all the"
"8197",140,"miracles and terrors for granted, to work without hearing the rumbling"
"8198",140,"and crashing. From blind fear he went to the other extreme; he became"
"8199",140,"reckless and indifferent, like all the rest of the men, who took"
"8200",140,"but little thought of themselves in the ardor of their work. It was"
"8201",140,"wonderful, when one came to think of it, that these men should have"
"8202",140,"taken an interest in the work they did--they had no share in it--they"
"8203",140,"were paid by the hour, and paid no more for being interested. Also they"
"8204",140,"knew that if they were hurt they would be flung aside and forgotten--and"
"8205",140,"still they would hurry to their task by dangerous short cuts, would use"
"8206",140,"methods that were quicker and more effective in spite of the fact"
"8207",140,"that they were also risky. His fourth day at his work Jurgis saw a man"
"8208",140,"stumble while running in front of a car, and have his foot mashed off,"
"8209",140,"and before he had been there three weeks he was witness of a yet more"
"8210",140,"dreadful accident. There was a row of brick furnaces, shining white"
"8211",140,"through every crack with the molten steel inside. Some of these were"
"8212",140,"bulging dangerously, yet men worked before them, wearing blue glasses"
"8213",140,"when they opened and shut the doors. One morning as Jurgis was passing,"
"8214",140,"a furnace blew out, spraying two men with a shower of liquid fire. As"
"8215",140,"they lay screaming and rolling upon the ground in agony, Jurgis rushed"
"8216",140,"to help them, and as a result he lost a good part of the skin from the"
"8217",140,"inside of one of his hands. The company doctor bandaged it up, but he"
"8218",140,"got no other thanks from any one, and was laid up for eight working days"
"8219",140,"without any pay."
"8220",140,""
"8221",140,"Most fortunately, at this juncture, Elzbieta got the long-awaited chance"
"8222",140,"to go at five o'clock in the morning and help scrub the office floors of"
"8223",140,"one of the packers. Jurgis came home and covered himself with blankets"
"8224",140,"to keep warm, and divided his time between sleeping and playing with"
"8225",140,"little Antanas. Juozapas was away raking in the dump a good part of the"
"8226",140,"time, and Elzbieta and Marija were hunting for more work."
"8227",140,""
"8228",140,"Antanas was now over a year and a half old, and was a perfect talking"
"8229",140,"machine. He learned so fast that every week when Jurgis came home it"
"8230",140,"seemed to him as if he had a new child. He would sit down and listen and"
"8231",140,"stare at him, and give vent to delighted exclamations--""Palauk! Muma!"
"8232",140,"Tu mano szirdele!"" The little fellow was now really the one delight"
"8233",140,"that Jurgis had in the world--his one hope, his one victory. Thank God,"
"8234",140,"Antanas was a boy! And he was as tough as a pine knot, and with the"
"8235",140,"appetite of a wolf. Nothing had hurt him, and nothing could hurt him;"
"8236",140,"he had come through all the suffering and deprivation unscathed--only"
"8237",140,"shriller-voiced and more determined in his grip upon life. He was a"
"8238",140,"terrible child to manage, was Antanas, but his father did not mind"
"8239",140,"that--he would watch him and smile to himself with satisfaction. The"
"8240",140,"more of a fighter he was the better--he would need to fight before he"
"8241",140,"got through."
"8242",140,""
"8243",140,"Jurgis had got the habit of buying the Sunday paper whenever he had the"
"8244",140,"money; a most wonderful paper could be had for only five cents, a whole"
"8245",140,"armful, with all the news of the world set forth in big headlines, that"
"8246",140,"Jurgis could spell out slowly, with the children to help him at the long"
"8247",140,"words. There was battle and murder and sudden death--it was marvelous"
"8248",140,"how they ever heard about so many entertaining and thrilling happenings;"
"8249",140,"the stories must be all true, for surely no man could have made such"
"8250",140,"things up, and besides, there were pictures of them all, as real as"
"8251",140,"life. One of these papers was as good as a circus, and nearly as good"
"8252",140,"as a spree--certainly a most wonderful treat for a workingman, who was"
"8253",140,"tired out and stupefied, and had never had any education, and whose work"
"8254",140,"was one dull, sordid grind, day after day, and year after year, with"
"8255",140,"never a sight of a green field nor an hour's entertainment, nor anything"
"8256",140,"but liquor to stimulate his imagination. Among other things, these"
"8257",140,"papers had pages full of comical pictures, and these were the main joy"
"8258",140,"in life to little Antanas. He treasured them up, and would drag them out"
"8259",140,"and make his father tell him about them; there were all sorts of animals"
"8260",140,"among them, and Antanas could tell the names of all of them, lying"
"8261",140,"upon the floor for hours and pointing them out with his chubby little"
"8262",140,"fingers. Whenever the story was plain enough for Jurgis to make out,"
"8263",140,"Antanas would have it repeated to him, and then he would remember it,"
"8264",140,"prattling funny little sentences and mixing it up with other stories in"
"8265",140,"an irresistible fashion. Also his quaint pronunciation of words was"
"8266",140,"such a delight--and the phrases he would pick up and remember, the most"
"8267",140,"outlandish and impossible things! The first time that the little rascal"
"8268",140,"burst out with ""God damn,"" his father nearly rolled off the chair"
"8269",140,"with glee; but in the end he was sorry for this, for Antanas was soon"
"8270",140,"""God-damning"" everything and everybody."
"8271",140,""
"8272",140,"And then, when he was able to use his hands, Jurgis took his bedding"
"8273",140,"again and went back to his task of shifting rails. It was now April, and"
"8274",140,"the snow had given place to cold rains, and the unpaved street in front"
"8275",140,"of Aniele's house was turned into a canal. Jurgis would have to wade"
"8276",140,"through it to get home, and if it was late he might easily get stuck to"
"8277",140,"his waist in the mire. But he did not mind this much--it was a promise"
"8278",140,"that summer was coming. Marija had now gotten a place as beef-trimmer"
"8279",140,"in one of the smaller packing plants; and he told himself that he had"
"8280",140,"learned his lesson now, and would meet with no more accidents--so that"
"8281",140,"at last there was prospect of an end to their long agony. They could"
"8282",140,"save money again, and when another winter came they would have a"
"8283",140,"comfortable place; and the children would be off the streets and in"
"8284",140,"school again, and they might set to work to nurse back into life their"
"8285",140,"habits of decency and kindness. So once more Jurgis began to make plans"
"8286",140,"and dream dreams."
"8287",140,""
"8288",140,"And then one Saturday night he jumped off the car and started home, with"
"8289",140,"the sun shining low under the edge of a bank of clouds that had been"
"8290",140,"pouring floods of water into the mud-soaked street. There was a rainbow"
"8291",140,"in the sky, and another in his breast--for he had thirty-six hours' rest"
"8292",140,"before him, and a chance to see his family. Then suddenly he came in"
"8293",140,"sight of the house, and noticed that there was a crowd before the door."
"8294",140,"He ran up the steps and pushed his way in, and saw Aniele's kitchen"
"8295",140,"crowded with excited women. It reminded him so vividly of the time when"
"8296",140,"he had come home from jail and found Ona dying, that his heart almost"
"8297",140,"stood still. ""What's the matter?"" he cried."
"8298",140,""
"8299",140,"A dead silence had fallen in the room, and he saw that every one was"
"8300",140,"staring at him. ""What's the matter?"" he exclaimed again."
"8301",140,""
"8302",140,"And then, up in the garret, he heard sounds of wailing, in Marija's"
"8303",140,"voice. He started for the ladder--and Aniele seized him by the arm. ""No,"
"8304",140,"no!"" she exclaimed. ""Don't go up there!"""
"8305",140,""
"8306",140,"""What is it?"" he shouted."
"8307",140,""
"8308",140,"And the old woman answered him weakly: ""It's Antanas. He's dead. He was"
"8309",140,"drowned out in the street!"""

"8313",140,""
"8314",140,""
"8315",140,"Jurgis took the news in a peculiar way. He turned deadly pale, but he"
"8316",140,"caught himself, and for half a minute stood in the middle of the room,"
"8317",140,"clenching his hands tightly and setting his teeth. Then he pushed Aniele"
"8318",140,"aside and strode into the next room and climbed the ladder."
"8319",140,""
"8320",140,"In the corner was a blanket, with a form half showing beneath it; and"
"8321",140,"beside it lay Elzbieta, whether crying or in a faint, Jurgis could not"
"8322",140,"tell. Marija was pacing the room, screaming and wringing her hands. He"
"8323",140,"clenched his hands tighter yet, and his voice was hard as he spoke."
"8324",140,""
"8325",140,"""How did it happen?"" he asked."
"8326",140,""
"8327",140,"Marija scarcely heard him in her agony. He repeated the question,"
"8328",140,"louder and yet more harshly. ""He fell off the sidewalk!"" she wailed."
"8329",140,"The sidewalk in front of the house was a platform made of half-rotten"
"8330",140,"boards, about five feet above the level of the sunken street."
"8331",140,""
"8332",140,"""How did he come to be there?"" he demanded."
"8333",140,""
"8334",140,"""He went--he went out to play,"" Marija sobbed, her voice choking her."
"8335",140,"""We couldn't make him stay in. He must have got caught in the mud!"""
"8336",140,""
"8337",140,"""Are you sure that he is dead?"" he demanded."
"8338",140,""
"8339",140,"""Ai! ai!"" she wailed. ""Yes; we had the doctor."""
"8340",140,""
"8341",140,"Then Jurgis stood a few seconds, wavering. He did not shed a tear. He"
"8342",140,"took one glance more at the blanket with the little form beneath it,"
"8343",140,"and then turned suddenly to the ladder and climbed down again. A silence"
"8344",140,"fell once more in the room as he entered. He went straight to the door,"
"8345",140,"passed out, and started down the street."
"8346",140,""
"8347",140,"When his wife had died, Jurgis made for the nearest saloon, but he did"
"8348",140,"not do that now, though he had his week's wages in his pocket. He walked"
"8349",140,"and walked, seeing nothing, splashing through mud and water. Later on he"
"8350",140,"sat down upon a step and hid his face in his hands and for half an hour"
"8351",140,"or so he did not move. Now and then he would whisper to himself: ""Dead!"
"8352",140,"Dead!"""
"8353",140,""
"8354",140,"Finally, he got up and walked on again. It was about sunset, and he went"
"8355",140,"on and on until it was dark, when he was stopped by a railroad crossing."
"8356",140,"The gates were down, and a long train of freight cars was thundering by."
"8357",140,"He stood and watched it; and all at once a wild impulse seized him, a"
"8358",140,"thought that had been lurking within him, unspoken, unrecognized, leaped"
"8359",140,"into sudden life. He started down the track, and when he was past the"
"8360",140,"gate-keeper's shanty he sprang forward and swung himself on to one of"
"8361",140,"the cars."
"8362",140,""
"8363",140,"By and by the train stopped again, and Jurgis sprang down and ran under"
"8364",140,"the car, and hid himself upon the truck. Here he sat, and when the train"
"8365",140,"started again, he fought a battle with his soul. He gripped his hands"
"8366",140,"and set his teeth together--he had not wept, and he would not--not a"
"8367",140,"tear! It was past and over, and he was done with it--he would fling it"
"8368",140,"off his shoulders, be free of it, the whole business, that night. It"
"8369",140,"should go like a black, hateful nightmare, and in the morning he would"
"8370",140,"be a new man. And every time that a thought of it assailed him--a tender"
"8371",140,"memory, a trace of a tear--he rose up, cursing with rage, and pounded it"
"8372",140,"down."
"8373",140,""
"8374",140,"He was fighting for his life; he gnashed his teeth together in his"
"8375",140,"desperation. He had been a fool, a fool! He had wasted his life, he had"
"8376",140,"wrecked himself, with his accursed weakness; and now he was done with"
"8377",140,"it--he would tear it out of him, root and branch! There should be no"
"8378",140,"more tears and no more tenderness; he had had enough of them--they had"
"8379",140,"sold him into slavery! Now he was going to be free, to tear off his"
"8380",140,"shackles, to rise up and fight. He was glad that the end had come--it"
"8381",140,"had to come some time, and it was just as well now. This was no world"
"8382",140,"for women and children, and the sooner they got out of it the better"
"8383",140,"for them. Whatever Antanas might suffer where he was, he could suffer"
"8384",140,"no more than he would have had he stayed upon earth. And meantime his"
"8385",140,"father had thought the last thought about him that he meant to; he was"
"8386",140,"going to think of himself, he was going to fight for himself, against"
"8387",140,"the world that had baffled him and tortured him!"
"8388",140,""
"8389",140,"So he went on, tearing up all the flowers from the garden of his soul,"
"8390",140,"and setting his heel upon them. The train thundered deafeningly, and"
"8391",140,"a storm of dust blew in his face; but though it stopped now and then"
"8392",140,"through the night, he clung where he was--he would cling there until"
"8393",140,"he was driven off, for every mile that he got from Packingtown meant"
"8394",140,"another load from his mind."
"8395",140,""
"8396",140,"Whenever the cars stopped a warm breeze blew upon him, a breeze laden"
"8397",140,"with the perfume of fresh fields, of honeysuckle and clover. He snuffed"
"8398",140,"it, and it made his heart beat wildly--he was out in the country again!"
"8399",140,"He was going to live in the country! When the dawn came he was peering"
"8400",140,"out with hungry eyes, getting glimpses of meadows and woods and rivers."
"8401",140,"At last he could stand it no longer, and when the train stopped again he"
"8402",140,"crawled out. Upon the top of the car was a brakeman, who shook his fist"
"8403",140,"and swore; Jurgis waved his hand derisively, and started across the"
"8404",140,"country."
"8405",140,""
"8406",140,"Only think that he had been a countryman all his life; and for three"
"8407",140,"long years he had never seen a country sight nor heard a country sound!"
"8408",140,"Excepting for that one walk when he left jail, when he was too much"
"8409",140,"worried to notice anything, and for a few times that he had rested"
"8410",140,"in the city parks in the winter time when he was out of work, he had"
"8411",140,"literally never seen a tree! And now he felt like a bird lifted up"
"8412",140,"and borne away upon a gale; he stopped and stared at each new sight of"
"8413",140,"wonder--at a herd of cows, and a meadow full of daisies, at hedgerows"
"8414",140,"set thick with June roses, at little birds singing in the trees."
"8415",140,""
"8416",140,"Then he came to a farm-house, and after getting himself a stick for"
"8417",140,"protection, he approached it. The farmer was greasing a wagon in"
"8418",140,"front of the barn, and Jurgis went to him. ""I would like to get some"
"8419",140,"breakfast, please,"" he said."
"8420",140,""
"8421",140,"""Do you want to work?"" said the farmer."
"8422",140,""
"8423",140,"""No,"" said Jurgis. ""I don't."""
"8424",140,""
"8425",140,"""Then you can't get anything here,"" snapped the other."
"8426",140,""
"8427",140,"""I meant to pay for it,"" said Jurgis."
"8428",140,""
"8429",140,"""Oh,"" said the farmer; and then added sarcastically, ""We don't serve"
"8430",140,"breakfast after 7 A.M."""
"8431",140,""
"8432",140,"""I am very hungry,"" said Jurgis gravely; ""I would like to buy some"
"8433",140,"food."""
"8434",140,""
"8435",140,"""Ask the woman,"" said the farmer, nodding over his shoulder. The ""woman"""
"8436",140,"was more tractable, and for a dime Jurgis secured two thick sandwiches"
"8437",140,"and a piece of pie and two apples. He walked off eating the pie, as the"
"8438",140,"least convenient thing to carry. In a few minutes he came to a stream,"
"8439",140,"and he climbed a fence and walked down the bank, along a woodland path."
"8440",140,"By and by he found a comfortable spot, and there he devoured his meal,"
"8441",140,"slaking his thirst at the stream. Then he lay for hours, just gazing and"
"8442",140,"drinking in joy; until at last he felt sleepy, and lay down in the shade"
"8443",140,"of a bush."
"8444",140,""
"8445",140,"When he awoke the sun was shining hot in his face. He sat up and"
"8446",140,"stretched his arms, and then gazed at the water sliding by. There was a"
"8447",140,"deep pool, sheltered and silent, below him, and a sudden wonderful idea"
"8448",140,"rushed upon him. He might have a bath! The water was free, and he might"
"8449",140,"get into it--all the way into it! It would be the first time that he had"
"8450",140,"been all the way into the water since he left Lithuania!"
"8451",140,""
"8452",140,"When Jurgis had first come to the stockyards he had been as clean as any"
"8453",140,"workingman could well be. But later on, what with sickness and cold"
"8454",140,"and hunger and discouragement, and the filthiness of his work, and the"
"8455",140,"vermin in his home, he had given up washing in winter, and in summer"
"8456",140,"only as much of him as would go into a basin. He had had a shower bath"
"8457",140,"in jail, but nothing since--and now he would have a swim!"
"8458",140,""
"8459",140,"The water was warm, and he splashed about like a very boy in his glee."
"8460",140,"Afterward he sat down in the water near the bank, and proceeded to scrub"
"8461",140,"himself--soberly and methodically, scouring every inch of him with sand."
"8462",140,"While he was doing it he would do it thoroughly, and see how it felt to"
"8463",140,"be clean. He even scrubbed his head with sand, and combed what the men"
"8464",140,"called ""crumbs"" out of his long, black hair, holding his head under"
"8465",140,"water as long as he could, to see if he could not kill them all. Then,"
"8466",140,"seeing that the sun was still hot, he took his clothes from the bank"
"8467",140,"and proceeded to wash them, piece by piece; as the dirt and grease went"
"8468",140,"floating off downstream he grunted with satisfaction and soused the"
"8469",140,"clothes again, venturing even to dream that he might get rid of the"
"8470",140,"fertilizer."
"8471",140,""
"8472",140,"He hung them all up, and while they were drying he lay down in the sun"
"8473",140,"and had another long sleep. They were hot and stiff as boards on top,"
"8474",140,"and a little damp on the underside, when he awakened; but being hungry,"
"8475",140,"he put them on and set out again. He had no knife, but with some labor"
"8476",140,"he broke himself a good stout club, and, armed with this, he marched"
"8477",140,"down the road again."
"8478",140,""
"8479",140,"Before long he came to a big farmhouse, and turned up the lane that led"
"8480",140,"to it. It was just supper-time, and the farmer was washing his hands at"
"8481",140,"the kitchen door. ""Please, sir,"" said Jurgis, ""can I have something to"
"8482",140,"eat? I can pay."" To which the farmer responded promptly, ""We don't feed"
"8483",140,"tramps here. Get out!"""
"8484",140,""
"8485",140,"Jurgis went without a word; but as he passed round the barn he came to"
"8486",140,"a freshly ploughed and harrowed field, in which the farmer had set out"
"8487",140,"some young peach trees; and as he walked he jerked up a row of them by"
"8488",140,"the roots, more than a hundred trees in all, before he reached the end"
"8489",140,"of the field. That was his answer, and it showed his mood; from now on"
"8490",140,"he was fighting, and the man who hit him would get all that he gave,"
"8491",140,"every time."
"8492",140,""
"8493",140,"Beyond the orchard Jurgis struck through a patch of woods, and then a"
"8494",140,"field of winter grain, and came at last to another road. Before long he"
"8495",140,"saw another farmhouse, and, as it was beginning to cloud over a little,"
"8496",140,"he asked here for shelter as well as food. Seeing the farmer eying him"
"8497",140,"dubiously, he added, ""I'll be glad to sleep in the barn."""
"8498",140,""
"8499",140,"""Well, I dunno,"" said the other. ""Do you smoke?"""
"8500",140,""
"8501",140,"""Sometimes,"" said Jurgis, ""but I'll do it out of doors."" When the man"
"8502",140,"had assented, he inquired, ""How much will it cost me? I haven't very"
"8503",140,"much money."""
"8504",140,""
"8505",140,"""I reckon about twenty cents for supper,"" replied the farmer. ""I won't"
"8506",140,"charge ye for the barn."""
"8507",140,""
"8508",140,"So Jurgis went in, and sat down at the table with the farmer's wife and"
"8509",140,"half a dozen children. It was a bountiful meal--there were baked beans"
"8510",140,"and mashed potatoes and asparagus chopped and stewed, and a dish of"
"8511",140,"strawberries, and great, thick slices of bread, and a pitcher of milk."
"8512",140,"Jurgis had not had such a feast since his wedding day, and he made a"
"8513",140,"mighty effort to put in his twenty cents' worth."
"8514",140,""
"8515",140,"They were all of them too hungry to talk; but afterward they sat upon"
"8516",140,"the steps and smoked, and the farmer questioned his guest. When Jurgis"
"8517",140,"had explained that he was a workingman from Chicago, and that he did not"
"8518",140,"know just whither he was bound, the other said, ""Why don't you stay here"
"8519",140,"and work for me?"""
"8520",140,""
"8521",140,"""I'm not looking for work just now,"" Jurgis answered."
"8522",140,""
"8523",140,"""I'll pay ye good,"" said the other, eying his big form--""a dollar a day"
"8524",140,"and board ye. Help's terrible scarce round here."""
"8525",140,""
"8526",140,"""Is that winter as well as summer?"" Jurgis demanded quickly."
"8527",140,""
"8528",140,"""N--no,"" said the farmer; ""I couldn't keep ye after November--I ain't"
"8529",140,"got a big enough place for that."""
"8530",140,""
"8531",140,"""I see,"" said the other, ""that's what I thought. When you get through"
"8532",140,"working your horses this fall, will you turn them out in the snow?"""
"8533",140,"(Jurgis was beginning to think for himself nowadays.)"
"8534",140,""
"8535",140,"""It ain't quite the same,"" the farmer answered, seeing the point. ""There"
"8536",140,"ought to be work a strong fellow like you can find to do, in the cities,"
"8537",140,"or some place, in the winter time."""
"8538",140,""
"8539",140,"""Yes,"" said Jurgis, ""that's what they all think; and so they crowd into"
"8540",140,"the cities, and when they have to beg or steal to live, then people"
"8541",140,"ask 'em why they don't go into the country, where help is scarce."" The"
"8542",140,"farmer meditated awhile."
"8543",140,""
"8544",140,"""How about when your money's gone?"" he inquired, finally. ""You'll have"
"8545",140,"to, then, won't you?"""
"8546",140,""
"8547",140,"""Wait till she's gone,"" said Jurgis; ""then I'll see."""
"8548",140,""
"8549",140,"He had a long sleep in the barn and then a big breakfast of coffee and"
"8550",140,"bread and oatmeal and stewed cherries, for which the man charged him"
"8551",140,"only fifteen cents, perhaps having been influenced by his arguments."
"8552",140,"Then Jurgis bade farewell, and went on his way."
"8553",140,""
"8554",140,""
"8555",140,"Such was the beginning of his life as a tramp. It was seldom he got"
"8556",140,"as fair treatment as from this last farmer, and so as time went on he"
"8557",140,"learned to shun the houses and to prefer sleeping in the fields. When"
"8558",140,"it rained he would find a deserted building, if he could, and if not,"
"8559",140,"he would wait until after dark and then, with his stick ready, begin a"
"8560",140,"stealthy approach upon a barn. Generally he could get in before the dog"
"8561",140,"got scent of him, and then he would hide in the hay and be safe until"
"8562",140,"morning; if not, and the dog attacked him, he would rise up and make a"
"8563",140,"retreat in battle order. Jurgis was not the mighty man he had once been,"
"8564",140,"but his arms were still good, and there were few farm dogs he needed to"
"8565",140,"hit more than once."
"8566",140,""
"8567",140,"Before long there came raspberries, and then blackberries, to help him"
"8568",140,"save his money; and there were apples in the orchards and potatoes in"
"8569",140,"the ground--he learned to note the places and fill his pockets after"
"8570",140,"dark. Twice he even managed to capture a chicken, and had a feast, once"
"8571",140,"in a deserted barn and the other time in a lonely spot alongside of a"
"8572",140,"stream. When all of these things failed him he used his money carefully,"
"8573",140,"but without worry--for he saw that he could earn more whenever he chose."
"8574",140,"Half an hour's chopping wood in his lively fashion was enough to bring"
"8575",140,"him a meal, and when the farmer had seen him working he would sometimes"
"8576",140,"try to bribe him to stay."
"8577",140,""
"8578",140,"But Jurgis was not staying. He was a free man now, a buccaneer. The old"
"8579",140,"wanderlust had got into his blood, the joy of the unbound life, the"
"8580",140,"joy of seeking, of hoping without limit. There were mishaps and"
"8581",140,"discomforts--but at least there was always something new; and only think"
"8582",140,"what it meant to a man who for years had been penned up in one place,"
"8583",140,"seeing nothing but one dreary prospect of shanties and factories, to be"
"8584",140,"suddenly set loose beneath the open sky, to behold new landscapes,"
"8585",140,"new places, and new people every hour! To a man whose whole life had"
"8586",140,"consisted of doing one certain thing all day, until he was so exhausted"
"8587",140,"that he could only lie down and sleep until the next day--and to be now"
"8588",140,"his own master, working as he pleased and when he pleased, and facing a"
"8589",140,"new adventure every hour!"
"8590",140,""
"8591",140,"Then, too, his health came back to him, all his lost youthful vigor, his"
"8592",140,"joy and power that he had mourned and forgotten! It came with a sudden"
"8593",140,"rush, bewildering him, startling him; it was as if his dead childhood"
"8594",140,"had come back to him, laughing and calling! What with plenty to eat and"
"8595",140,"fresh air and exercise that was taken as it pleased him, he would waken"
"8596",140,"from his sleep and start off not knowing what to do with his energy,"
"8597",140,"stretching his arms, laughing, singing old songs of home that came back"
"8598",140,"to him. Now and then, of course, he could not help but think of little"
"8599",140,"Antanas, whom he should never see again, whose little voice he should"

"8601",140,"night he would waken dreaming of Ona, and stretch out his arms to her,"
"8602",140,"and wet the ground with his tears. But in the morning he would get up"
"8603",140,"and shake himself, and stride away again to battle with the world."
"8604",140,""
"8605",140,"He never asked where he was nor where he was going; the country was big"
"8606",140,"enough, he knew, and there was no danger of his coming to the end of it."
"8607",140,"And of course he could always have company for the asking--everywhere he"
"8608",140,"went there were men living just as he lived, and whom he was welcome to"
"8609",140,"join. He was a stranger at the business, but they were not clannish, and"
"8610",140,"they taught him all their tricks--what towns and villages it was best"
"8611",140,"to keep away from, and how to read the secret signs upon the fences, and"
"8612",140,"when to beg and when to steal, and just how to do both. They laughed at"
"8613",140,"his ideas of paying for anything with money or with work--for they got"
"8614",140,"all they wanted without either. Now and then Jurgis camped out with"
"8615",140,"a gang of them in some woodland haunt, and foraged with them in the"
"8616",140,"neighborhood at night. And then among them some one would ""take a shine"""
"8617",140,"to him, and they would go off together and travel for a week, exchanging"
"8618",140,"reminiscences."
"8619",140,""
"8620",140,"Of these professional tramps a great many had, of course, been shiftless"
"8621",140,"and vicious all their lives. But the vast majority of them had been"
"8622",140,"workingmen, had fought the long fight as Jurgis had, and found that it"
"8623",140,"was a losing fight, and given up. Later on he encountered yet another"
"8624",140,"sort of men, those from whose ranks the tramps were recruited, men who"
"8625",140,"were homeless and wandering, but still seeking work--seeking it in the"
"8626",140,"harvest fields. Of these there was an army, the huge surplus labor army"
"8627",140,"of society; called into being under the stern system of nature, to"
"8628",140,"do the casual work of the world, the tasks which were transient and"
"8629",140,"irregular, and yet which had to be done. They did not know that they"
"8630",140,"were such, of course; they only knew that they sought the job, and that"
"8631",140,"the job was fleeting. In the early summer they would be in Texas, and"
"8632",140,"as the crops were ready they would follow north with the season, ending"
"8633",140,"with the fall in Manitoba. Then they would seek out the big lumber"
"8634",140,"camps, where there was winter work; or failing in this, would drift to"
"8635",140,"the cities, and live upon what they had managed to save, with the"
"8636",140,"help of such transient work as was there the loading and unloading of"
"8637",140,"steamships and drays, the digging of ditches and the shoveling of snow."
"8638",140,"If there were more of them on hand than chanced to be needed, the weaker"
"8639",140,"ones died off of cold and hunger, again according to the stern system of"

"8641",140,""
"8642",140,"It was in the latter part of July, when Jurgis was in Missouri, that"
"8643",140,"he came upon the harvest work. Here were crops that men had worked for"
"8644",140,"three or four months to prepare, and of which they would lose nearly"
"8645",140,"all unless they could find others to help them for a week or two. So all"
"8646",140,"over the land there was a cry for labor--agencies were set up and all"
"8647",140,"the cities were drained of men, even college boys were brought by the"
"8648",140,"carload, and hordes of frantic farmers would hold up trains and carry"
"8649",140,"off wagon-loads of men by main force. Not that they did not pay them"
"8650",140,"well--any man could get two dollars a day and his board, and the best"
"8651",140,"men could get two dollars and a half or three."
"8652",140,""
"8653",140,"The harvest-fever was in the very air, and no man with any spirit in"
"8654",140,"him could be in that region and not catch it. Jurgis joined a gang and"
"8655",140,"worked from dawn till dark, eighteen hours a day, for two weeks without"
"8656",140,"a break. Then he had a sum of money that would have been a fortune to"
"8657",140,"him in the old days of misery--but what could he do with it now? To be"
"8658",140,"sure he might have put it in a bank, and, if he were fortunate, get"
"8659",140,"it back again when he wanted it. But Jurgis was now a homeless man,"
"8660",140,"wandering over a continent; and what did he know about banking and"
"8661",140,"drafts and letters of credit? If he carried the money about with him, he"
"8662",140,"would surely be robbed in the end; and so what was there for him to do"
"8663",140,"but enjoy it while he could? On a Saturday night he drifted into a town"
"8664",140,"with his fellows; and because it was raining, and there was no other"
"8665",140,"place provided for him, he went to a saloon. And there were some who"
"8666",140,"treated him and whom he had to treat, and there was laughter and singing"
"8667",140,"and good cheer; and then out of the rear part of the saloon a girl's"
"8668",140,"face, red-cheeked and merry, smiled at Jurgis, and his heart thumped"
"8669",140,"suddenly in his throat. He nodded to her, and she came and sat by him,"
"8670",140,"and they had more drink, and then he went upstairs into a room with her,"
"8671",140,"and the wild beast rose up within him and screamed, as it has screamed"
"8672",140,"in the Jungle from the dawn of time. And then because of his memories"
"8673",140,"and his shame, he was glad when others joined them, men and women; and"
"8674",140,"they had more drink and spent the night in wild rioting and debauchery."
"8675",140,"In the van of the surplus-labor army, there followed another, an army of"
"8676",140,"women, they also struggling for life under the stern system of nature."
"8677",140,"Because there were rich men who sought pleasure, there had been ease and"
"8678",140,"plenty for them so long as they were young and beautiful; and later on,"
"8679",140,"when they were crowded out by others younger and more beautiful, they"
"8680",140,"went out to follow upon the trail of the workingmen. Sometimes they came"
"8681",140,"of themselves, and the saloon-keepers shared with them; or sometimes"
"8682",140,"they were handled by agencies, the same as the labor army. They were in"
"8683",140,"the towns in harvest time, near the lumber camps in the winter, in"
"8684",140,"the cities when the men came there; if a regiment were encamped, or a"
"8685",140,"railroad or canal being made, or a great exposition getting ready, the"
"8686",140,"crowd of women were on hand, living in shanties or saloons or tenement"

"8689",140,"In the morning Jurgis had not a cent, and he went out upon the road"
"8690",140,"again. He was sick and disgusted, but after the new plan of his life, he"

"8692",140,"not help it now--all he could do was to see that it did not happen"

"8697",140,"the majority of these men of the road, who roamed until the hunger for"

"8705",140,""
"8706",140,"One night he was caught by a thunderstorm, and he sought shelter in a"
"8707",140,"little house just outside of a town. It was a working-man's home, and"
"8708",140,"the owner was a Slav like himself, a new emigrant from White Russia; he"
"8709",140,"bade Jurgis welcome in his home language, and told him to come to the"
"8710",140,"kitchen-fire and dry himself. He had no bed for him, but there was straw"
"8711",140,"in the garret, and he could make out. The man's wife was cooking the"
"8712",140,"supper, and their children were playing about on the floor. Jurgis sat"
"8713",140,"and exchanged thoughts with him about the old country, and the places"
"8714",140,"where they had been and the work they had done. Then they ate, and"
"8715",140,"afterward sat and smoked and talked more about America, and how they"
"8716",140,"found it. In the middle of a sentence, however, Jurgis stopped, seeing"
"8717",140,"that the woman had brought a big basin of water and was proceeding to"
"8718",140,"undress her youngest baby. The rest had crawled into the closet where"
"8719",140,"they slept, but the baby was to have a bath, the workingman explained."
"8720",140,"The nights had begun to be chilly, and his mother, ignorant as to the"
"8721",140,"climate in America, had sewed him up for the winter; then it had turned"
"8722",140,"warm again, and some kind of a rash had broken out on the child. The"
"8723",140,"doctor had said she must bathe him every night, and she, foolish woman,"

"8728",140,"round ball of a stomach, and eyes as black as coals. His pimples did"
"8729",140,"not seem to bother him much, and he was wild with glee over the bath,"
"8730",140,"kicking and squirming and chuckling with delight, pulling at his"
"8731",140,"mother's face and then at his own little toes. When she put him into the"
"8732",140,"basin he sat in the midst of it and grinned, splashing the water over"
"8733",140,"himself and squealing like a little pig. He spoke in Russian, of which"
"8734",140,"Jurgis knew some; he spoke it with the quaintest of baby accents--and"

"8884",140,"his corner in a close though unheated room, with a window opening upon"
"8885",140,"a blank wall two feet away; and also he had the bare streets, with"
"8886",140,"the winter gales sweeping through them; besides this he had only the"
"8887",140,"saloons--and, of course, he had to drink to stay in them. If he drank"
"8888",140,"now and then he was free to make himself at home, to gamble with dice or"
"8889",140,"a pack of greasy cards, to play at a dingy pool table for money, or to"
"8890",140,"look at a beer-stained pink ""sporting paper,"" with pictures of murderers"
"8891",140,"and half-naked women. It was for such pleasures as these that he spent"
"8892",140,"his money; and such was his life during the six weeks and a half that he"

"8896",140,"In a work thus carried out, not much thought was given to the welfare of"

"8907",140,""
"8908",140,"When he opened his eyes again it was to the clanging of the bell of"
"8909",140,"an ambulance. He was lying in it, covered by a blanket, and it was"
"8910",140,"threading its way slowly through the holiday-shopping crowds. They took"
"8911",140,"him to the county hospital, where a young surgeon set his arm; then he"
"8912",140,"was washed and laid upon a bed in a ward with a score or two more of"
"8913",140,"maimed and mangled men."
"8914",140,""
"8915",140,"Jurgis spent his Christmas in this hospital, and it was the pleasantest"
"8916",140,"Christmas he had had in America. Every year there were scandals and"
"8917",140,"investigations in this institution, the newspapers charging that doctors"
"8918",140,"were allowed to try fantastic experiments upon the patients; but Jurgis"
"8919",140,"knew nothing of this--his only complaint was that they used to feed him"
"8920",140,"upon tinned meat, which no man who had ever worked in Packingtown would"
"8921",140,"feed to his dog. Jurgis had often wondered just who ate the canned"
"8922",140,"corned beef and ""roast beef"" of the stockyards; now he began to"
"8923",140,"understand--that it was what you might call ""graft meat,"" put up to"
"8924",140,"be sold to public officials and contractors, and eaten by soldiers and"
"8925",140,"sailors, prisoners and inmates of institutions, ""shantymen"" and gangs of"
"8926",140,"railroad laborers."
"8927",140,""
"8928",140,"Jurgis was ready to leave the hospital at the end of two weeks. This"
"8929",140,"did not mean that his arm was strong and that he was able to go back to"
"8930",140,"work, but simply that he could get along without further attention, and"
"8931",140,"that his place was needed for some one worse off than he. That he was"
"8932",140,"utterly helpless, and had no means of keeping himself alive in the"
"8933",140,"meantime, was something which did not concern the hospital authorities,"
"8934",140,"nor any one else in the city."
"8935",140,""
"8936",140,"As it chanced, he had been hurt on a Monday, and had just paid for his"
"8937",140,"last week's board and his room rent, and spent nearly all the balance of"
"8938",140,"his Saturday's pay. He had less than seventy-five cents in his pockets,"
"8939",140,"and a dollar and a half due him for the day's work he had done before he"
"8940",140,"was hurt. He might possibly have sued the company, and got some damages"
"8941",140,"for his injuries, but he did not know this, and it was not the company's"
"8942",140,"business to tell him. He went and got his pay and his tools, which he"
"8943",140,"left in a pawnshop for fifty cents. Then he went to his landlady,"
"8944",140,"who had rented his place and had no other for him; and then to his"
"8945",140,"boardinghouse keeper, who looked him over and questioned him. As he must"
"8946",140,"certainly be helpless for a couple of months, and had boarded there only"
"8947",140,"six weeks, she decided very quickly that it would not be worth the risk"
"8948",140,"to keep him on trust."
"8949",140,""
"8950",140,"So Jurgis went out into the streets, in a most dreadful plight. It was"
"8951",140,"bitterly cold, and a heavy snow was falling, beating into his face."
"8952",140,"He had no overcoat, and no place to go, and two dollars and sixty-five"
"8953",140,"cents in his pocket, with the certainty that he could not earn another"
"8954",140,"cent for months. The snow meant no chance to him now; he must walk along"
"8955",140,"and see others shoveling, vigorous and active--and he with his left arm"
"8956",140,"bound to his side! He could not hope to tide himself over by odd jobs"
"8957",140,"of loading trucks; he could not even sell newspapers or carry satchels,"
"8958",140,"because he was now at the mercy of any rival. Words could not paint the"
"8959",140,"terror that came over him as he realized all this. He was like a wounded"
"8960",140,"animal in the forest; he was forced to compete with his enemies upon"
"8961",140,"unequal terms. There would be no consideration for him because of his"
"8962",140,"weakness--it was no one's business to help him in such distress, to make"
"8963",140,"the fight the least bit easier for him. Even if he took to begging, he"
"8964",140,"would be at a disadvantage, for reasons which he was to discover in good"
"8965",140,"time."
"8966",140,""
"8967",140,"In the beginning he could not think of anything except getting out of"
"8968",140,"the awful cold. He went into one of the saloons he had been wont to"
"8969",140,"frequent and bought a drink, and then stood by the fire shivering and"
"8970",140,"waiting to be ordered out. According to an unwritten law, the buying a"
"8971",140,"drink included the privilege of loafing for just so long; then one"
"8972",140,"had to buy another drink or move on. That Jurgis was an old customer"
"8973",140,"entitled him to a somewhat longer stop; but then he had been away two"
"8974",140,"weeks, and was evidently ""on the bum."" He might plead and tell his ""hard"
"8975",140,"luck story,"" but that would not help him much; a saloon-keeper who was"
"8976",140,"to be moved by such means would soon have his place jammed to the doors"
"8977",140,"with ""hoboes"" on a day like this."
"8978",140,""
"8979",140,"So Jurgis went out into another place, and paid another nickel. He"
"8980",140,"was so hungry this time that he could not resist the hot beef stew, an"
"8981",140,"indulgence which cut short his stay by a considerable time. When he was"
"8982",140,"again told to move on, he made his way to a ""tough"" place in the"
"8983",140,"""Levee"" district, where now and then he had gone with a certain rat-eyed"
"8984",140,"Bohemian workingman of his acquaintance, seeking a woman. It was"
"8985",140,"Jurgis's vain hope that here the proprietor would let him remain as a"
"8986",140,"""sitter."" In low-class places, in the dead of winter, saloon-keepers"
"8987",140,"would often allow one or two forlorn-looking bums who came in covered"
"8988",140,"with snow or soaked with rain to sit by the fire and look miserable to"
"8989",140,"attract custom. A workingman would come in, feeling cheerful after his"
"8990",140,"day's work was over, and it would trouble him to have to take his glass"
"8991",140,"with such a sight under his nose; and so he would call out: ""Hello, Bub,"
"8992",140,"what's the matter? You look as if you'd been up against it!"" And then"
"8993",140,"the other would begin to pour out some tale of misery, and the man would"
"8994",140,"say, ""Come have a glass, and maybe that'll brace you up."" And so"
"8995",140,"they would drink together, and if the tramp was sufficiently"
"8996",140,"wretched-looking, or good enough at the ""gab,"" they might have two; and"
"8997",140,"if they were to discover that they were from the same country, or had"
"8998",140,"lived in the same city or worked at the same trade, they might sit down"
"8999",140,"at a table and spend an hour or two in talk--and before they got through"
"9000",140,"the saloon-keeper would have taken in a dollar. All of this might seem"
"9001",140,"diabolical, but the saloon-keeper was in no wise to blame for it. He"
"9002",140,"was in the same plight as the manufacturer who has to adulterate and"
"9003",140,"misrepresent his product. If he does not, some one else will; and the"
"9004",140,"saloon-keeper, unless he is also an alderman, is apt to be in debt to"
"9005",140,"the big brewers, and on the verge of being sold out."
"9006",140,""
"9007",140,"The market for ""sitters"" was glutted that afternoon, however, and there"
"9008",140,"was no place for Jurgis. In all he had to spend six nickels in keeping a"
"9009",140,"shelter over him that frightful day, and then it was just dark, and"
"9010",140,"the station houses would not open until midnight! At the last place,"
"9011",140,"however, there was a bartender who knew him and liked him, and let him"
"9012",140,"doze at one of the tables until the boss came back; and also, as he"
"9013",140,"was going out, the man gave him a tip--on the next block there was a"
"9014",140,"religious revival of some sort, with preaching and singing, and hundreds"
"9015",140,"of hoboes would go there for the shelter and warmth."
"9016",140,""
"9017",140,"Jurgis went straightway, and saw a sign hung out, saying that the door"
"9018",140,"would open at seven-thirty; then he walked, or half ran, a block, and"
"9019",140,"hid awhile in a doorway and then ran again, and so on until the hour."
"9020",140,"At the end he was all but frozen, and fought his way in with the rest of"
"9021",140,"the throng (at the risk of having his arm broken again), and got close"
"9022",140,"to the big stove."
"9023",140,""
"9024",140,"By eight o'clock the place was so crowded that the speakers ought to"
"9025",140,"have been flattered; the aisles were filled halfway up, and at the door"
"9026",140,"men were packed tight enough to walk upon. There were three elderly"
"9027",140,"gentlemen in black upon the platform, and a young lady who played the"
"9028",140,"piano in front. First they sang a hymn, and then one of the three, a"
"9029",140,"tall, smooth-shaven man, very thin, and wearing black spectacles, began"
"9030",140,"an address. Jurgis heard smatterings of it, for the reason that terror"
"9031",140,"kept him awake--he knew that he snored abominably, and to have been put"
"9032",140,"out just then would have been like a sentence of death to him."
"9033",140,""
"9034",140,"The evangelist was preaching ""sin and redemption,"" the infinite grace of"
"9035",140,"God and His pardon for human frailty. He was very much in earnest, and"
"9036",140,"he meant well, but Jurgis, as he listened, found his soul filled with"
"9037",140,"hatred. What did he know about sin and suffering--with his smooth, black"
"9038",140,"coat and his neatly starched collar, his body warm, and his belly full,"
"9039",140,"and money in his pocket--and lecturing men who were struggling for their"
"9040",140,"lives, men at the death grapple with the demon powers of hunger and"
"9041",140,"cold!--This, of course, was unfair; but Jurgis felt that these men were"
"9042",140,"out of touch with the life they discussed, that they were unfitted to"
"9043",140,"solve its problems; nay, they themselves were part of the problem--they"
"9044",140,"were part of the order established that was crushing men down and"
"9045",140,"beating them! They were of the triumphant and insolent possessors; they"
"9046",140,"had a hall, and a fire, and food and clothing and money, and so they"
"9047",140,"might preach to hungry men, and the hungry men must be humble and"
"9048",140,"listen! They were trying to save their souls--and who but a fool could"
"9049",140,"fail to see that all that was the matter with their souls was that they"
"9050",140,"had not been able to get a decent existence for their bodies?"
"9051",140,""
"9052",140,"At eleven the meeting closed, and the desolate audience filed out into"
"9053",140,"the snow, muttering curses upon the few traitors who had got repentance"
"9054",140,"and gone up on the platform. It was yet an hour before the station"
"9055",140,"house would open, and Jurgis had no overcoat--and was weak from a long"
"9056",140,"illness. During that hour he nearly perished. He was obliged to run hard"
"9057",140,"to keep his blood moving at all--and then he came back to the station"
"9058",140,"house and found a crowd blocking the street before the door! This was in"
"9059",140,"the month of January, 1904, when the country was on the verge of ""hard"
"9060",140,"times,"" and the newspapers were reporting the shutting down of factories"
"9061",140,"every day--it was estimated that a million and a half men were thrown"
"9062",140,"out of work before the spring. So all the hiding places of the city were"
"9063",140,"crowded, and before that station house door men fought and tore each"
"9064",140,"other like savage beasts. When at last the place was jammed and they"
"9065",140,"shut the doors, half the crowd was still outside; and Jurgis, with his"
"9066",140,"helpless arm, was among them. There was no choice then but to go to a"
"9067",140,"lodging-house and spend another dime. It really broke his heart to do"
"9068",140,"this, at half-past twelve o'clock, after he had wasted the night at the"
"9069",140,"meeting and on the street. He would be turned out of the lodging-house"
"9070",140,"promptly at seven--they had the shelves which served as bunks so"
"9071",140,"contrived that they could be dropped, and any man who was slow about"
"9072",140,"obeying orders could be tumbled to the floor."
"9073",140,""
"9074",140,"This was one day, and the cold spell lasted for fourteen of them. At the"
"9075",140,"end of six days every cent of Jurgis' money was gone; and then he went"
"9076",140,"out on the streets to beg for his life."
"9077",140,""
"9078",140,"He would begin as soon as the business of the city was moving. He would"
"9079",140,"sally forth from a saloon, and, after making sure there was no policeman"
"9080",140,"in sight, would approach every likely-looking person who passed him,"
"9081",140,"telling his woeful story and pleading for a nickel or a dime. Then when"
"9082",140,"he got one, he would dart round the corner and return to his base to get"
"9083",140,"warm; and his victim, seeing him do this, would go away, vowing that he"
"9084",140,"would never give a cent to a beggar again. The victim never paused to"
"9085",140,"ask where else Jurgis could have gone under the circumstances--where"
"9086",140,"he, the victim, would have gone. At the saloon Jurgis could not only get"
"9087",140,"more food and better food than he could buy in any restaurant for the"
"9088",140,"same money, but a drink in the bargain to warm him up. Also he could"
"9089",140,"find a comfortable seat by a fire, and could chat with a companion until"
"9090",140,"he was as warm as toast. At the saloon, too, he felt at home. Part of"
"9091",140,"the saloon-keeper's business was to offer a home and refreshments to"
"9092",140,"beggars in exchange for the proceeds of their foragings; and was there"
"9093",140,"any one else in the whole city who would do this--would the victim have"
"9094",140,"done it himself?"
"9095",140,""
"9096",140,"Poor Jurgis might have been expected to make a successful beggar. He"
"9097",140,"was just out of the hospital, and desperately sick-looking, and with"
"9098",140,"a helpless arm; also he had no overcoat, and shivered pitifully. But,"
"9099",140,"alas, it was again the case of the honest merchant, who finds that the"
"9100",140,"genuine and unadulterated article is driven to the wall by the artistic"
"9101",140,"counterfeit. Jurgis, as a beggar, was simply a blundering amateur in"
"9102",140,"competition with organized and scientific professionalism. He was just"
"9103",140,"out of the hospital--but the story was worn threadbare, and how could"
"9104",140,"he prove it? He had his arm in a sling--and it was a device a regular"
"9105",140,"beggar's little boy would have scorned. He was pale and shivering--but"
"9106",140,"they were made up with cosmetics, and had studied the art of chattering"
"9107",140,"their teeth. As to his being without an overcoat, among them you would"
"9108",140,"meet men you could swear had on nothing but a ragged linen duster and"
"9109",140,"a pair of cotton trousers--so cleverly had they concealed the several"
"9110",140,"suits of all-wool underwear beneath. Many of these professional"
"9111",140,"mendicants had comfortable homes, and families, and thousands of dollars"
"9112",140,"in the bank; some of them had retired upon their earnings, and gone into"
"9113",140,"the business of fitting out and doctoring others, or working children"
"9114",140,"at the trade. There were some who had both their arms bound tightly to"
"9115",140,"their sides, and padded stumps in their sleeves, and a sick child hired"
"9116",140,"to carry a cup for them. There were some who had no legs, and pushed"
"9117",140,"themselves upon a wheeled platform--some who had been favored with"
"9118",140,"blindness, and were led by pretty little dogs. Some less fortunate had"
"9119",140,"mutilated themselves or burned themselves, or had brought horrible sores"
"9120",140,"upon themselves with chemicals; you might suddenly encounter upon the"
"9121",140,"street a man holding out to you a finger rotting and discolored with"
"9122",140,"gangrene--or one with livid scarlet wounds half escaped from their"
"9123",140,"filthy bandages. These desperate ones were the dregs of the city's"
"9124",140,"cesspools, wretches who hid at night in the rain-soaked cellars of"
"9125",140,"old ramshackle tenements, in ""stale-beer dives"" and opium joints, with"
"9126",140,"abandoned women in the last stages of the harlot's progress--women who"
"9127",140,"had been kept by Chinamen and turned away at last to die. Every day"
"9128",140,"the police net would drag hundreds of them off the streets, and in the"
"9129",140,"detention hospital you might see them, herded together in a miniature"
"9130",140,"inferno, with hideous, beastly faces, bloated and leprous with disease,"
"9131",140,"laughing, shouting, screaming in all stages of drunkenness, barking like"
"9132",140,"dogs, gibbering like apes, raving and tearing themselves in delirium."

"9139",140,"In the face of all his handicaps, Jurgis was obliged to make the"
"9140",140,"price of a lodging, and of a drink every hour or two, under penalty of"
"9141",140,"freezing to death. Day after day he roamed about in the arctic cold,"
"9142",140,"his soul filled full of bitterness and despair. He saw the world of"
"9143",140,"civilization then more plainly than ever he had seen it before; a world"
"9144",140,"in which nothing counted but brutal might, an order devised by those who"
"9145",140,"possessed it for the subjugation of those who did not. He was one of"
"9146",140,"the latter; and all outdoors, all life, was to him one colossal prison,"
"9147",140,"which he paced like a pent-up tiger, trying one bar after another, and"
"9148",140,"finding them all beyond his power. He had lost in the fierce battle of"
"9149",140,"greed, and so was doomed to be exterminated; and all society was busied"
"9150",140,"to see that he did not escape the sentence. Everywhere that he turned"
"9151",140,"were prison bars, and hostile eyes following him; the well-fed, sleek"
"9152",140,"policemen, from whose glances he shrank, and who seemed to grip their"
"9153",140,"clubs more tightly when they saw him; the saloon-keepers, who never"
"9154",140,"ceased to watch him while he was in their places, who were jealous"
"9155",140,"of every moment he lingered after he had paid his money; the hurrying"
"9156",140,"throngs upon the streets, who were deaf to his entreaties, oblivious of"
"9157",140,"his very existence--and savage and contemptuous when he forced himself"
"9158",140,"upon them. They had their own affairs, and there was no place for him"
"9159",140,"among them. There was no place for him anywhere--every direction he"
"9160",140,"turned his gaze, this fact was forced upon him: Everything was built"
"9161",140,"to express it to him: the residences, with their heavy walls and bolted"
"9162",140,"doors, and basement windows barred with iron; the great warehouses"
"9163",140,"filled with the products of the whole world, and guarded by iron"
"9164",140,"shutters and heavy gates; the banks with their unthinkable billions of"

"9168",140,"And then one day there befell Jurgis the one adventure of his life. It"

"9171",140,"and was chilled to the bone. He was working among the theater crowds,"
"9172",140,"flitting here and there, taking large chances with the police, in his"
"9173",140,"desperation half hoping to be arrested. When he saw a blue-coat start"

"9175",140,"street and fled a couple of blocks. When he stopped again he saw a man"
"9176",140,"coming toward him, and placed himself in his path."
"9177",140,""
"9178",140,"""Please, sir,"" he began, in the usual formula, ""will you give me the"

"9185",140,"halted, and Jurgis suddenly noticed that he stood a little unsteadily."
"9186",140,"""Whuzzat you say?"" he queried suddenly, in a thick voice."

"9513",140,"by a fountain, a figure ravishingly beautiful, the flesh warm and"
"9514",140,"glowing with the hues of life. Above was a huge court, with domed roof,"
"9515",140,"the various apartments opening into it. The butler had paused below but"
"9516",140,"a few minutes to give orders, and then followed them; now he pressed a"
"9517",140,"button, and the hall blazed with light. He opened a door before them,"
"9518",140,"and then pressed another button, as they staggered into the apartment."
"9519",140,""
"9520",140,"It was fitted up as a study. In the center was a mahogany table, covered"
"9521",140,"with books, and smokers' implements; the walls were decorated"
"9522",140,"with college trophies and colors--flags, posters, photographs and"
"9523",140,"knickknacks--tennis rackets, canoe paddles, golf clubs, and polo sticks."
"9524",140,"An enormous moose head, with horns six feet across, faced a buffalo head"
"9525",140,"on the opposite wall, while bear and tiger skins covered the polished"
"9526",140,"floor. There were lounging chairs and sofas, window seats covered with"
"9527",140,"soft cushions of fantastic designs; there was one corner fitted in"
"9528",140,"Persian fashion, with a huge canopy and a jeweled lamp beneath. Beyond,"
"9529",140,"a door opened upon a bedroom, and beyond that was a swimming pool of the"
"9530",140,"purest marble, that had cost about forty thousand dollars."
"9531",140,""
"9532",140,"Master Freddie stood for a moment or two, gazing about him; then out"
"9533",140,"of the next room a dog emerged, a monstrous bulldog, the most hideous"
"9534",140,"object that Jurgis had ever laid eyes upon. He yawned, opening a mouth"
"9535",140,"like a dragon's; and he came toward the young man, wagging his tail."
"9536",140,"""Hello, Dewey!"" cried his master. ""Been havin' a snooze, ole boy? Well,"
"9537",140,"well--hello there, whuzzamatter?"" (The dog was snarling at Jurgis.)"

"9543",140,"The speaker sank into one of the big armchairs, and Admiral Dewey"
"9544",140,"crouched beneath it; he did not snarl again, but he never took his eyes"
"9545",140,"off Jurgis. He was perfectly sober, was the Admiral."
"9546",140,""
"9547",140,"The butler had closed the door, and he stood by it, watching Jurgis"
"9548",140,"every second. Now there came footsteps outside, and, as he opened the"
"9549",140,"door a man in livery entered, carrying a folding table, and behind him"
"9550",140,"two men with covered trays. They stood like statues while the first"
"9551",140,"spread the table and set out the contents of the trays upon it."
"9552",140,"There were cold pates, and thin slices of meat, tiny bread and butter"
"9553",140,"sandwiches with the crust cut off, a bowl of sliced peaches and cream"
"9554",140,"(in January), little fancy cakes, pink and green and yellow and white,"
"9555",140,"and half a dozen ice-cold bottles of wine."

"9557",140,"""Thass the stuff for you!"" cried Master Freddie, exultantly, as he spied"
"9558",140,"them. ""Come 'long, ole chappie, move up."""

"9560",140,"And he seated himself at the table; the waiter pulled a cork, and he"
"9561",140,"took the bottle and poured three glasses of its contents in succession"
"9562",140,"down his throat. Then he gave a long-drawn sigh, and cried again to"
"9563",140,"Jurgis to seat himself."

"9565",140,"The butler held the chair at the opposite side of the table, and Jurgis"

"9567",140,"it was the other's intention to put it under him, and so he sat"
"9568",140,"down, cautiously and mistrustingly. Master Freddie perceived that the"
"9569",140,"attendants embarrassed him, and he remarked with a nod to them, ""You may"
"9570",140,"go."""
"9571",140,""
"9572",140,"They went, all save the butler."
"9573",140,""

"9576",140,"""Master Frederick--"" the man began."
"9577",140,""
"9578",140,"""Go!"" cried the youngster, angrily. ""Damn you, don't you hear me?"""
"9579",140,""
"9580",140,"The man went out and closed the door; Jurgis, who was as sharp as he,"
"9581",140,"observed that he took the key out of the lock, in order that he might"
"9582",140,"peer through the keyhole."
"9583",140,""
"9584",140,"Master Frederick turned to the table again. ""Now,"" he said, ""go for it."""

"9592",140,"candy--you go on."""
"9593",140,""
"9594",140,"So Jurgis began, without further parley. He ate as with two shovels, his"
"9595",140,"fork in one hand and his knife in the other; when he once got started"
"9596",140,"his wolf-hunger got the better of him, and he did not stop for breath"
"9597",140,"until he had cleared every plate. ""Gee whiz!"" said the other, who had"
"9598",140,"been watching him in wonder."
"9599",140,""
"9600",140,"Then he held Jurgis the bottle. ""Lessee you drink now,"" he said; and"
"9601",140,"Jurgis took the bottle and turned it up to his mouth, and a wonderfully"
"9602",140,"unearthly liquid ecstasy poured down his throat, tickling every nerve of"
"9603",140,"him, thrilling him with joy. He drank the very last drop of it, and then"
"9604",140,"he gave vent to a long-drawn ""Ah!"""
"9605",140,""
"9606",140,"""Good stuff, hey?"" said Freddie, sympathetically; he had leaned back in"
"9607",140,"the big chair, putting his arm behind his head and gazing at Jurgis."
"9608",140,""
"9609",140,"And Jurgis gazed back at him. He was clad in spotless evening dress, was"
"9610",140,"Freddie, and looked very handsome--he was a beautiful boy, with"
"9611",140,"light golden hair and the head of an Antinous. He smiled at Jurgis"
"9612",140,"confidingly, and then started talking again, with his blissful"
"9613",140,"insouciance. This time he talked for ten minutes at a stretch, and in"
"9614",140,"the course of the speech he told Jurgis all of his family history. His"
"9615",140,"big brother Charlie was in love with the guileless maiden who played the"
"9616",140,"part of ""Little Bright-Eyes"" in ""The Kaliph of Kamskatka."" He had been"
"9617",140,"on the verge of marrying her once, only ""the guv'ner"" had sworn to"
"9618",140,"disinherit him, and had presented him with a sum that would stagger the"
"9619",140,"imagination, and that had staggered the virtue of ""Little Bright-Eyes."""
"9620",140,"Now Charlie had got leave from college, and had gone away in his"
"9621",140,"automobile on the next best thing to a honeymoon. ""The guv'ner"" had made"
"9622",140,"threats to disinherit another of his children also, sister Gwendolen,"
"9623",140,"who had married an Italian marquis with a string of titles and a dueling"
"9624",140,"record. They lived in his chateau, or rather had, until he had taken to"
"9625",140,"firing the breakfast dishes at her; then she had cabled for help, and"
"9626",140,"the old gentleman had gone over to find out what were his Grace's terms."
"9627",140,"So they had left Freddie all alone, and he with less than two thousand"
"9628",140,"dollars in his pocket. Freddie was up in arms and meant serious"
"9629",140,"business, as they would find in the end--if there was no other way of"
"9630",140,"bringing them to terms he would have his ""Kittens"" wire that she was"
"9631",140,"about to marry him, and see what happened then."
"9632",140,""
"9633",140,"So the cheerful youngster rattled on, until he was tired out. He smiled"
"9634",140,"his sweetest smile at Jurgis, and then he closed his eyes, sleepily."
"9635",140,"Then he opened them again, and smiled once more, and finally closed them"
"9636",140,"and forgot to open them."
"9637",140,""
"9638",140,"For several minutes Jurgis sat perfectly motionless, watching him, and"
"9639",140,"reveling in the strange sensation of the champagne. Once he stirred,"
"9640",140,"and the dog growled; after that he sat almost holding his breath--until"
"9641",140,"after a while the door of the room opened softly, and the butler came"
"9642",140,"in."
"9643",140,""
"9644",140,"He walked toward Jurgis upon tiptoe, scowling at him; and Jurgis rose"
"9645",140,"up, and retreated, scowling back. So until he was against the wall, and"
"9646",140,"then the butler came close, and pointed toward the door. ""Get out of"
"9647",140,"here!"" he whispered."
"9648",140,""
"9649",140,"Jurgis hesitated, giving a glance at Freddie, who was snoring softly."
"9650",140,"""If you do, you son of a--"" hissed the butler, ""I'll mash in your face"
"9651",140,"for you before you get out of here!"""
"9652",140,""
"9653",140,"And Jurgis wavered but an instant more. He saw ""Admiral Dewey"" coming"
"9654",140,"up behind the man and growling softly, to back up his threats. Then he"
"9655",140,"surrendered and started toward the door."
"9656",140,""
"9657",140,"They went out without a sound, and down the great echoing staircase,"
"9658",140,"and through the dark hall. At the front door he paused, and the butler"
"9659",140,"strode close to him."
"9660",140,""
"9661",140,"""Hold up your hands,"" he snarled. Jurgis took a step back, clinching his"
"9662",140,"one well fist."
"9663",140,""
"9664",140,"""What for?"" he cried; and then understanding that the fellow proposed to"
"9665",140,"search him, he answered, ""I'll see you in hell first."""
"9666",140,""
"9667",140,"""Do you want to go to jail?"" demanded the butler, menacingly. ""I'll have"
"9668",140,"the police--"""
"9669",140,""
"9670",140,"""Have 'em!"" roared Jurgis, with fierce passion. ""But you won't put"
"9671",140,"your hands on me till you do! I haven't touched anything in your damned"
"9672",140,"house, and I'll not have you touch me!"""
"9673",140,""
"9674",140,"So the butler, who was terrified lest his young master should waken,"
"9675",140,"stepped suddenly to the door, and opened it. ""Get out of here!"" he said;"
"9676",140,"and then as Jurgis passed through the opening, he gave him a ferocious"
"9677",140,"kick that sent him down the great stone steps at a run, and landed him"

"9685",140,"Jurgis got up, wild with rage, but the door was shut and the great"
"9686",140,"castle was dark and impregnable. Then the icy teeth of the blast bit"
"9687",140,"into him, and he turned and went away at a run."
"9688",140,""
"9689",140,"When he stopped again it was because he was coming to frequented"
"9690",140,"streets and did not wish to attract attention. In spite of that last"
"9691",140,"humiliation, his heart was thumping fast with triumph. He had come out"
"9692",140,"ahead on that deal! He put his hand into his trousers' pocket every now"
"9693",140,"and then, to make sure that the precious hundred-dollar bill was still"
"9694",140,"there."
"9695",140,""
"9696",140,"Yet he was in a plight--a curious and even dreadful plight, when he came"

"9699",140,""
"9700",140,"Jurgis spent half an hour walking and debating the problem. There was"
"9701",140,"no one he could go to for help--he had to manage it all alone. To get"
"9702",140,"it changed in a lodging-house would be to take his life in his hands--he"
"9703",140,"would almost certainly be robbed, and perhaps murdered, before morning."
"9704",140,"He might go to some hotel or railroad depot and ask to have it changed;"
"9705",140,"but what would they think, seeing a ""bum"" like him with a hundred"
"9706",140,"dollars? He would probably be arrested if he tried it; and what story"
"9707",140,"could he tell? On the morrow Freddie Jones would discover his loss, and"
"9708",140,"there would be a hunt for him, and he would lose his money. The only"
"9709",140,"other plan he could think of was to try in a saloon. He might pay them"
"9710",140,"to change it, if it could not be done otherwise."
"9711",140,""
"9712",140,"He began peering into places as he walked; he passed several as being"
"9713",140,"too crowded--then finally, chancing upon one where the bartender was all"
"9714",140,"alone, he gripped his hands in sudden resolution and went in."
"9715",140,""
"9716",140,"""Can you change me a hundred-dollar bill?"" he demanded."
"9717",140,""
"9718",140,"The bartender was a big, husky fellow, with the jaw of a prize fighter,"
"9719",140,"and a three weeks' stubble of hair upon it. He stared at Jurgis. ""What's"

"9736",140,""
"9737",140,"Then Jurgis slowly and warily approached him; he took out the bill, and"
"9738",140,"fumbled it for a moment, while the man stared at him with hostile eyes"
"9739",140,"across the counter. Then finally he handed it over."

"9746",140,"""Humph,"" he said, finally, and gazed at the stranger, sizing him up--a"

"9754",140,"counter. Then he turned to the cash register, and punched up five cents,"
"9755",140,"and began to pull money out of the drawer. Finally, he faced Jurgis,"
"9756",140,"counting it out--two dimes, a quarter, and fifty cents. ""There,"" he"

"9771",140,"seized the glass and hurled it at the other's head. The man ducked, and"
"9772",140,"it missed him by half an inch; he rose again and faced Jurgis, who was"
"9773",140,"vaulting over the bar with his one well arm, and dealt him a smashing"

"9781",140,"of the door. Then Jurgis started back, rushing at the man again in the"
"9782",140,"middle of the room. This time, in his blind frenzy, he came without a"
"9783",140,"bottle, and that was all the bartender wanted--he met him halfway and"
"9784",140,"floored him with a sledgehammer drive between the eyes. An instant later"
"9785",140,"the screen doors flew open, and two men rushed in--just as Jurgis was"

"9799",140,"still blazed in him, and he got to his feet, lunging into the air. Then"

"10017",140,"overcoat, and then his coat, and then his vest, searching inside and"
"10018",140,"outside, and transferring the contents into his own pockets. At last,"

"10027",140,"letters and checks, and two theater-tickets, and at last, in the back"
"10028",140,"part, a wad of bills. He counted them--there was a twenty, five tens,"
"10029",140,"four fives, and three ones. Duane drew a long breath. ""That lets us"

"10034",140,"locket. Then Duane took the watch and trinkets downstairs, and came back"
"10035",140,"with sixteen dollars. ""The old scoundrel said the case was filled,"" he"
"10036",140,"said. ""It's a lie, but he knows I want the money."""

"10051",140,"the third within a week, and the police were apparently powerless. The"
"10052",140,"victim was an insurance agent, and he had lost a hundred and ten dollars"
"10053",140,"that did not belong to him. He had chanced to have his name marked"
"10054",140,"on his shirt, otherwise he would not have been identified yet. His"
"10055",140,"assailant had hit him too hard, and he was suffering from concussion of"
"10056",140,"the brain; and also he had been half-frozen when found, and would lose"
"10057",140,"three fingers on his right hand. The enterprising newspaper reporter had"
"10058",140,"taken all this information to his family, and told how they had received"
"10059",140,"it."
"10060",140,""
"10061",140,"Since it was Jurgis's first experience, these details naturally caused"
"10062",140,"him some worriment; but the other laughed coolly--it was the way of the"
"10063",140,"game, and there was no helping it. Before long Jurgis would think no"
"10064",140,"more of it than they did in the yards of knocking out a bullock. ""It's a"
"10065",140,"case of us or the other fellow, and I say the other fellow, every time,"""

"10076",140,"police. Therefore it would be better for Jurgis to stay in hiding and"
"10077",140,"never be seen in public with his pal. But Jurgis soon got very tired"
"10078",140,"of staying in hiding. In a couple of weeks he was feeling strong and"
"10079",140,"beginning to use his arm, and then he could not stand it any longer."
"10080",140,"Duane, who had done a job of some sort by himself, and made a truce with"
"10081",140,"the powers, brought over Marie, his little French girl, to share with"
"10082",140,"him; but even that did not avail for long, and in the end he had to give"
"10083",140,"up arguing, and take Jurgis out and introduce him to the saloons and"
"10084",140,"""sporting houses"" where the big crooks and ""holdup men"" hung out."
"10085",140,""
"10086",140,"And so Jurgis got a glimpse of the high-class criminal world of"
"10087",140,"Chicago. The city, which was owned by an oligarchy of business men, being"
"10088",140,"nominally ruled by the people, a huge army of graft was necessary for"
"10089",140,"the purpose of effecting the transfer of power. Twice a year, in the"
"10090",140,"spring and fall elections, millions of dollars were furnished by the"
"10091",140,"business men and expended by this army; meetings were held and clever"
"10092",140,"speakers were hired, bands played and rockets sizzled, tons of documents"
"10093",140,"and reservoirs of drinks were distributed, and tens of thousands of"
"10094",140,"votes were bought for cash. And this army of graft had, of course, to be"
"10095",140,"maintained the year round. The leaders and organizers were maintained by"
"10096",140,"the business men directly--aldermen and legislators by means of bribes,"
"10097",140,"party officials out of the campaign funds, lobbyists and corporation"
"10098",140,"lawyers in the form of salaries, contractors by means of jobs, labor"
"10099",140,"union leaders by subsidies, and newspaper proprietors and editors by"
"10100",140,"advertisements. The rank and file, however, were either foisted upon the"
"10101",140,"city, or else lived off the population directly. There was the police"
"10102",140,"department, and the fire and water departments, and the whole balance"
"10103",140,"of the civil list, from the meanest office boy to the head of a city"
"10104",140,"department; and for the horde who could find no room in these, there was"
"10105",140,"the world of vice and crime, there was license to seduce, to swindle"
"10106",140,"and plunder and prey. The law forbade Sunday drinking; and this had"
"10107",140,"delivered the saloon-keepers into the hands of the police, and made an"
"10108",140,"alliance between them necessary. The law forbade prostitution; and this"
"10109",140,"had brought the ""madames"" into the combination. It was the same with the"
"10110",140,"gambling-house keeper and the poolroom man, and the same with any other"
"10111",140,"man or woman who had a means of getting ""graft,"" and was willing to"
"10112",140,"pay over a share of it: the green-goods man and the highwayman, the"
"10113",140,"pickpocket and the sneak thief, and the receiver of stolen goods,"
"10114",140,"the seller of adulterated milk, of stale fruit and diseased meat, the"
"10115",140,"proprietor of unsanitary tenements, the fake doctor and the usurer, the"
"10116",140,"beggar and the ""pushcart man,"" the prize fighter and the professional"
"10117",140,"slugger, the race-track ""tout,"" the procurer, the white-slave agent, and"
"10118",140,"the expert seducer of young girls. All of these agencies of corruption"
"10119",140,"were banded together, and leagued in blood brotherhood with the"
"10120",140,"politician and the police; more often than not they were one and the"
"10121",140,"same person,--the police captain would own the brothel he pretended"
"10122",140,"to raid, the politician would open his headquarters in his saloon."
"10123",140,"""Hinkydink"" or ""Bathhouse John,"" or others of that ilk, were proprietors"
"10124",140,"of the most notorious dives in Chicago, and also the ""gray wolves"""
"10125",140,"of the city council, who gave away the streets of the city to the"
"10126",140,"business men; and those who patronized their places were the gamblers and"
"10127",140,"prize fighters who set the law at defiance, and the burglars and holdup"
"10128",140,"men who kept the whole city in terror. On election day all these powers"
"10129",140,"of vice and crime were one power; they could tell within one per cent"
"10130",140,"what the vote of their district would be, and they could change it at an"
"10131",140,"hour's notice."
"10132",140,""
"10133",140,"A month ago Jurgis had all but perished of starvation upon the streets;"
"10134",140,"and now suddenly, as by the gift of a magic key, he had entered into a"
"10135",140,"world where money and all the good things of life came freely. He was"
"10136",140,"introduced by his friend to an Irishman named ""Buck"" Halloran, who was"
"10137",140,"a political ""worker"" and on the inside of things. This man talked with"
"10138",140,"Jurgis for a while, and then told him that he had a little plan by which"
"10139",140,"a man who looked like a workingman might make some easy money; but it"
"10140",140,"was a private affair, and had to be kept quiet. Jurgis expressed himself"
"10141",140,"as agreeable, and the other took him that afternoon (it was Saturday) to"
"10142",140,"a place where city laborers were being paid off. The paymaster sat in"
"10143",140,"a little booth, with a pile of envelopes before him, and two policemen"
"10144",140,"standing by. Jurgis went, according to directions, and gave the name of"
"10145",140,"""Michael O'Flaherty,"" and received an envelope, which he took around the"
"10146",140,"corner and delivered to Halloran, who was waiting for him in a saloon."
"10147",140,"Then he went again; and gave the name of ""Johann Schmidt,"" and a third"
"10148",140,"time, and give the name of ""Serge Reminitsky."" Halloran had quite a list"
"10149",140,"of imaginary workingmen, and Jurgis got an envelope for each one. For"
"10150",140,"this work he received five dollars, and was told that he might have it"
"10151",140,"every week, so long as he kept quiet. As Jurgis was excellent at keeping"
"10152",140,"quiet, he soon won the trust of ""Buck"" Halloran, and was introduced to"
"10153",140,"others as a man who could be depended upon."
"10154",140,""
"10155",140,"This acquaintance was useful to him in another way, also before long"
"10156",140,"Jurgis made his discovery of the meaning of ""pull,"" and just why his"
"10157",140,"boss, Connor, and also the pugilist bartender, had been able to send him"
"10158",140,"to jail. One night there was given a ball, the ""benefit"" of ""One-eyed"
"10159",140,"Larry,"" a lame man who played the violin in one of the big ""high-class"""
"10160",140,"houses of prostitution on Clark Street, and was a wag and a popular"
"10161",140,"character on the ""Levee."" This ball was held in a big dance hall, and"
"10162",140,"was one of the occasions when the city's powers of debauchery gave"
"10163",140,"themselves up to madness. Jurgis attended and got half insane with"
"10164",140,"drink, and began quarreling over a girl; his arm was pretty strong by"
"10165",140,"then, and he set to work to clean out the place, and ended in a cell in"
"10166",140,"the police station. The police station being crowded to the doors, and"
"10167",140,"stinking with ""bums,"" Jurgis did not relish staying there to sleep off"
"10168",140,"his liquor, and sent for Halloran, who called up the district leader and"
"10169",140,"had Jurgis bailed out by telephone at four o'clock in the morning. When"
"10170",140,"he was arraigned that same morning, the district leader had already seen"
"10171",140,"the clerk of the court and explained that Jurgis Rudkus was a decent"
"10172",140,"fellow, who had been indiscreet; and so Jurgis was fined ten dollars and"
"10173",140,"the fine was ""suspended""--which meant that he did not have to pay for"
"10174",140,"it, and never would have to pay it, unless somebody chose to bring it up"
"10175",140,"against him in the future."
"10176",140,""
"10177",140,"Among the people Jurgis lived with now money was valued according to an"
"10178",140,"entirely different standard from that of the people of Packingtown; yet,"
"10179",140,"strange as it may seem, he did a great deal less drinking than he had"
"10180",140,"as a workingman. He had not the same provocations of exhaustion and"
"10181",140,"hopelessness; he had now something to work for, to struggle for. He"
"10182",140,"soon found that if he kept his wits about him, he would come upon new"
"10183",140,"opportunities; and being naturally an active man, he not only kept sober"
"10184",140,"himself, but helped to steady his friend, who was a good deal fonder of"
"10185",140,"both wine and women than he."
"10186",140,""
"10187",140,"One thing led to another. In the saloon where Jurgis met ""Buck"" Halloran"
"10188",140,"he was sitting late one night with Duane, when a ""country customer"""
"10189",140,"(a buyer for an out-of-town merchant) came in, a little more than half"
"10190",140,"""piped."" There was no one else in the place but the bartender, and as"
"10191",140,"the man went out again Jurgis and Duane followed him; he went round"
"10192",140,"the corner, and in a dark place made by a combination of the elevated"
"10193",140,"railroad and an unrented building, Jurgis leaped forward and shoved a"
"10194",140,"revolver under his nose, while Duane, with his hat pulled over his eyes,"
"10195",140,"went through the man's pockets with lightning fingers. They got his"
"10196",140,"watch and his ""wad,"" and were round the corner again and into the saloon"
"10197",140,"before he could shout more than once. The bartender, to whom they had"
"10198",140,"tipped the wink, had the cellar door open for them, and they vanished,"
"10199",140,"making their way by a secret entrance to a brothel next door. From the"
"10200",140,"roof of this there was access to three similar places beyond. By means"
"10201",140,"of these passages the customers of any one place could be gotten out"
"10202",140,"of the way, in case a falling out with the police chanced to lead to a"
"10203",140,"raid; and also it was necessary to have a way of getting a girl out"
"10204",140,"of reach in case of an emergency. Thousands of them came to Chicago"
"10205",140,"answering advertisements for ""servants"" and ""factory hands,"" and found"
"10206",140,"themselves trapped by fake employment agencies, and locked up in a"
"10207",140,"bawdy-house. It was generally enough to take all their clothes away from"
"10208",140,"them; but sometimes they would have to be ""doped"" and kept prisoners for"
"10209",140,"weeks; and meantime their parents might be telegraphing the police, and"
"10210",140,"even coming on to see why nothing was done. Occasionally there was no"
"10211",140,"way of satisfying them but to let them search the place to which the"
"10212",140,"girl had been traced."
"10213",140,""
"10214",140,"For his help in this little job, the bartender received twenty out of"
"10215",140,"the hundred and thirty odd dollars that the pair secured; and naturally"
"10216",140,"this put them on friendly terms with him, and a few days later he"
"10217",140,"introduced them to a little ""sheeny"" named Goldberger, one of the"
"10218",140,"""runners"" of the ""sporting house"" where they had been hidden. After a"
"10219",140,"few drinks Goldberger began, with some hesitation, to narrate how he had"
"10220",140,"had a quarrel over his best girl with a professional ""cardsharp,"" who"
"10221",140,"had hit him in the jaw. The fellow was a stranger in Chicago, and if he"
"10222",140,"was found some night with his head cracked there would be no one to care"
"10223",140,"very much. Jurgis, who by this time would cheerfully have cracked the"
"10224",140,"heads of all the gamblers in Chicago, inquired what would be coming to"
"10225",140,"him; at which the Jew became still more confidential, and said that he"
"10226",140,"had some tips on the New Orleans races, which he got direct from the"
"10227",140,"police captain of the district, whom he had got out of a bad scrape, and"
"10228",140,"who ""stood in"" with a big syndicate of horse owners. Duane took all"
"10229",140,"this in at once, but Jurgis had to have the whole race-track situation"
"10230",140,"explained to him before he realized the importance of such an"
"10231",140,"opportunity."
"10232",140,""
"10233",140,"There was the gigantic Racing Trust. It owned the legislatures in"
"10234",140,"every state in which it did business; it even owned some of the big"
"10235",140,"newspapers, and made public opinion--there was no power in the land that"
"10236",140,"could oppose it unless, perhaps, it were the Poolroom Trust. It built"
"10237",140,"magnificent racing parks all over the country, and by means of enormous"
"10238",140,"purses it lured the people to come, and then it organized a gigantic"
"10239",140,"shell game, whereby it plundered them of hundreds of millions of dollars"
"10240",140,"every year. Horse racing had once been a sport, but nowadays it was"
"10241",140,"a business; a horse could be ""doped"" and doctored, undertrained or"
"10242",140,"overtrained; it could be made to fall at any moment--or its gait could"
"10243",140,"be broken by lashing it with the whip, which all the spectators would"
"10244",140,"take to be a desperate effort to keep it in the lead. There were scores"
"10245",140,"of such tricks; and sometimes it was the owners who played them and made"
"10246",140,"fortunes, sometimes it was the jockeys and trainers, sometimes it was"
"10247",140,"outsiders, who bribed them--but most of the time it was the chiefs"
"10248",140,"of the trust. Now for instance, they were having winter racing in New"
"10249",140,"Orleans and a syndicate was laying out each day's program in advance,"
"10250",140,"and its agents in all the Northern cities were ""milking"" the poolrooms."
"10251",140,"The word came by long-distance telephone in a cipher code, just a little"
"10252",140,"while before each race; and any man who could get the secret had as good"
"10253",140,"as a fortune. If Jurgis did not believe it, he could try it, said the"
"10254",140,"little Jew--let them meet at a certain house on the morrow and make a"
"10255",140,"test. Jurgis was willing, and so was Duane, and so they went to one"
"10256",140,"of the high-class poolrooms where brokers and merchants gambled (with"
"10257",140,"society women in a private room), and they put up ten dollars each upon"
"10258",140,"a horse called ""Black Beldame,"" a six to one shot, and won. For a secret"
"10259",140,"like that they would have done a good many sluggings--but the next day"
"10260",140,"Goldberger informed them that the offending gambler had got wind of what"
"10261",140,"was coming to him, and had skipped the town."
"10262",140,""
"10263",140,""
"10264",140,"There were ups and downs at the business; but there was always a living,"
"10265",140,"inside of a jail, if not out of it. Early in April the city elections"
"10266",140,"were due, and that meant prosperity for all the powers of graft. Jurgis,"
"10267",140,"hanging round in dives and gambling houses and brothels, met with"
"10268",140,"the heelers of both parties, and from their conversation he came to"
"10269",140,"understand all the ins and outs of the game, and to hear of a number of"
"10270",140,"ways in which he could make himself useful about election time. ""Buck"""
"10271",140,"Halloran was a ""Democrat,"" and so Jurgis became a Democrat also; but he"
"10272",140,"was not a bitter one--the Republicans were good fellows, too, and were"
"10273",140,"to have a pile of money in this next campaign. At the last election the"
"10274",140,"Republicans had paid four dollars a vote to the Democrats' three; and"
"10275",140,"""Buck"" Halloran sat one night playing cards with Jurgis and another man,"
"10276",140,"who told how Halloran had been charged with the job voting a ""bunch"" of"
"10277",140,"thirty-seven newly landed Italians, and how he, the narrator, had met"
"10278",140,"the Republican worker who was after the very same gang, and how the"
"10279",140,"three had effected a bargain, whereby the Italians were to vote half and"
"10280",140,"half, for a glass of beer apiece, while the balance of the fund went to"
"10281",140,"the conspirators!"
"10282",140,""
"10283",140,"Not long after this, Jurgis, wearying of the risks and vicissitudes"
"10284",140,"of miscellaneous crime, was moved to give up the career for that of a"
"10285",140,"politician. Just at this time there was a tremendous uproar being raised"
"10286",140,"concerning the alliance between the criminals and the police. For the"
"10287",140,"criminal graft was one in which the business men had no direct part--it"
"10288",140,"was what is called a ""side line,"" carried by the police. ""Wide"
"10289",140,"open"" gambling and debauchery made the city pleasing to ""trade,"" but"
"10290",140,"burglaries and holdups did not. One night it chanced that while Jack"
"10291",140,"Duane was drilling a safe in a clothing store he was caught red-handed"
"10292",140,"by the night watchman, and turned over to a policeman, who chanced to"
"10293",140,"know him well, and who took the responsibility of letting him make his"
"10294",140,"escape. Such a howl from the newspapers followed this that Duane was"
"10295",140,"slated for sacrifice, and barely got out of town in time. And just at"
"10296",140,"that juncture it happened that Jurgis was introduced to a man named"
"10297",140,"Harper whom he recognized as the night watchman at Brown's, who had been"
"10298",140,"instrumental in making him an American citizen, the first year of his"
"10299",140,"arrival at the yards. The other was interested in the coincidence, but"
"10300",140,"did not remember Jurgis--he had handled too many ""green ones"" in his"
"10301",140,"time, he said. He sat in a dance hall with Jurgis and Halloran until one"
"10302",140,"or two in the morning, exchanging experiences. He had a long story to"
"10303",140,"tell of his quarrel with the superintendent of his department, and how"
"10304",140,"he was now a plain workingman, and a good union man as well. It was not"
"10305",140,"until some months afterward that Jurgis understood that the quarrel with"
"10306",140,"the superintendent had been prearranged, and that Harper was in reality"
"10307",140,"drawing a salary of twenty dollars a week from the packers for an inside"
"10308",140,"report of his union's secret proceedings. The yards were seething with"
"10309",140,"agitation just then, said the man, speaking as a unionist. The people of"
"10310",140,"Packingtown had borne about all that they would bear, and it looked as"
"10311",140,"if a strike might begin any week."
"10312",140,""
"10313",140,"After this talk the man made inquiries concerning Jurgis, and a couple"
"10314",140,"of days later he came to him with an interesting proposition. He was"
"10315",140,"not absolutely certain, he said, but he thought that he could get him"
"10316",140,"a regular salary if he would come to Packingtown and do as he was told,"
"10317",140,"and keep his mouth shut. Harper--""Bush"" Harper, he was called--was a"
"10318",140,"right-hand man of Mike Scully, the Democratic boss of the stockyards;"
"10319",140,"and in the coming election there was a peculiar situation. There had"
"10320",140,"come to Scully a proposition to nominate a certain rich brewer who lived"
"10321",140,"upon a swell boulevard that skirted the district, and who coveted the"
"10322",140,"big badge and the ""honorable"" of an alderman. The brewer was a Jew, and"
"10323",140,"had no brains, but he was harmless, and would put up a rare campaign"
"10324",140,"fund. Scully had accepted the offer, and then gone to the Republicans"
"10325",140,"with a proposition. He was not sure that he could manage the ""sheeny,"""
"10326",140,"and he did not mean to take any chances with his district; let the"
"10327",140,"Republicans nominate a certain obscure but amiable friend of Scully's,"
"10328",140,"who was now setting tenpins in the cellar of an Ashland Avenue saloon,"
"10329",140,"and he, Scully, would elect him with the ""sheeny's"" money, and the"
"10330",140,"Republicans might have the glory, which was more than they would get"
"10331",140,"otherwise. In return for this the Republicans would agree to put up no"
"10332",140,"candidate the following year, when Scully himself came up for reelection"
"10333",140,"as the other alderman from the ward. To this the Republicans had"
"10334",140,"assented at once; but the hell of it was--so Harper explained--that"
"10335",140,"the Republicans were all of them fools--a man had to be a fool to be"
"10336",140,"a Republican in the stockyards, where Scully was king. And they didn't"
"10337",140,"know how to work, and of course it would not do for the Democratic"
"10338",140,"workers, the noble redskins of the War Whoop League, to support the"
"10339",140,"Republican openly. The difficulty would not have been so great except"
"10340",140,"for another fact--there had been a curious development in stockyards"
"10341",140,"politics in the last year or two, a new party having leaped into being."
"10342",140,"They were the Socialists; and it was a devil of a mess, said ""Bush"""
"10343",140,"Harper. The one image which the word ""Socialist"" brought to Jurgis was"
"10344",140,"of poor little Tamoszius Kuszleika, who had called himself one, and"
"10345",140,"would go out with a couple of other men and a soap-box, and shout"
"10346",140,"himself hoarse on a street corner Saturday nights. Tamoszius had tried"
"10347",140,"to explain to Jurgis what it was all about, but Jurgis, who was not of"
"10348",140,"an imaginative turn, had never quite got it straight; at present he was"
"10349",140,"content with his companion's explanation that the Socialists were the"
"10350",140,"enemies of American institutions--could not be bought, and would not"
"10351",140,"combine or make any sort of a ""dicker."" Mike Scully was very much"
"10352",140,"worried over the opportunity which his last deal gave to them--the"
"10353",140,"stockyards Democrats were furious at the idea of a rich capitalist"
"10354",140,"for their candidate, and while they were changing they might possibly"
"10355",140,"conclude that a Socialist firebrand was preferable to a Republican bum."
"10356",140,"And so right here was a chance for Jurgis to make himself a place in"
"10357",140,"the world, explained ""Bush"" Harper; he had been a union man, and he"
"10358",140,"was known in the yards as a workingman; he must have hundreds of"
"10359",140,"acquaintances, and as he had never talked politics with them he might"
"10360",140,"come out as a Republican now without exciting the least suspicion. There"
"10361",140,"were barrels of money for the use of those who could deliver the goods;"
"10362",140,"and Jurgis might count upon Mike Scully, who had never yet gone back on"
"10363",140,"a friend. Just what could he do? Jurgis asked, in some perplexity, and"
"10364",140,"the other explained in detail. To begin with, he would have to go to the"
"10365",140,"yards and work, and he mightn't relish that; but he would have what he"
"10366",140,"earned, as well as the rest that came to him. He would get active in the"
"10367",140,"union again, and perhaps try to get an office, as he, Harper, had; he"
"10368",140,"would tell all his friends the good points of Doyle, the Republican"
"10369",140,"nominee, and the bad ones of the ""sheeny""; and then Scully would"
"10370",140,"furnish a meeting place, and he would start the ""Young Men's Republican"
"10371",140,"Association,"" or something of that sort, and have the rich brewer's"
"10372",140,"best beer by the hogshead, and fireworks and speeches, just like the"
"10373",140,"War Whoop League. Surely Jurgis must know hundreds of men who would like"
"10374",140,"that sort of fun; and there would be the regular Republican leaders and"
"10375",140,"workers to help him out, and they would deliver a big enough majority on"
"10376",140,"election day."
"10377",140,""
"10378",140,"When he had heard all this explanation to the end, Jurgis demanded: ""But"
"10379",140,"how can I get a job in Packingtown? I'm blacklisted."""
"10380",140,""
"10381",140,"At which ""Bush"" Harper laughed. ""I'll attend to that all right,"" he"
"10382",140,"said."
"10383",140,""
"10384",140,"And the other replied, ""It's a go, then; I'm your man."" So Jurgis went"
"10385",140,"out to the stockyards again, and was introduced to the political lord of"
"10386",140,"the district, the boss of Chicago's mayor. It was Scully who owned the"
"10387",140,"brick-yards and the dump and the ice pond--though Jurgis did not know it."
"10388",140,"It was Scully who was to blame for the unpaved street in which Jurgis's"
"10389",140,"child had been drowned; it was Scully who had put into office the"
"10390",140,"magistrate who had first sent Jurgis to jail; it was Scully who was"
"10391",140,"principal stockholder in the company which had sold him the ramshackle"
"10392",140,"tenement, and then robbed him of it. But Jurgis knew none of these"
"10393",140,"things--any more than he knew that Scully was but a tool and puppet of"
"10394",140,"the packers. To him Scully was a mighty power, the ""biggest"" man he had"
"10395",140,"ever met."
"10396",140,""
"10397",140,"He was a little, dried-up Irishman, whose hands shook. He had a brief"
"10398",140,"talk with his visitor, watching him with his ratlike eyes, and making"
"10399",140,"up his mind about him; and then he gave him a note to Mr. Harmon, one of"
"10400",140,"the head managers of Durham's--"
"10401",140,""
"10402",140,"""The bearer, Jurgis Rudkus, is a particular friend of mine, and I would"

"10406",140,"Mr. Harmon looked up inquiringly when he read this. ""What does he mean"

"10409",140,"""I was blacklisted, sir,"" said Jurgis."
"10410",140,""
"10411",140,"At which the other frowned. ""Blacklisted?"" he said. ""How do you mean?"""
"10412",140,"And Jurgis turned red with embarrassment."
"10413",140,""
"10414",140,"He had forgotten that a blacklist did not exist. ""I--that is--I had"
"10415",140,"difficulty in getting a place,"" he stammered."

"10420",140,"him."""
"10421",140,""
"10422",140,"""I see,"" said the other, and meditated for a few moments. ""What do you"
"10423",140,"wish to do?"" he asked."
"10424",140,""
"10425",140,"""Anything, sir,"" said Jurgis--""only I had a broken arm this winter, and"

"10438",140,""
"10439",140,"And so Jurgis marched into the hog-killing room, a place where, in the"
"10440",140,"days gone by, he had come begging for a job. Now he walked jauntily, and"
"10441",140,"smiled to himself, seeing the frown that came to the boss's face as"
"10442",140,"the timekeeper said, ""Mr. Harmon says to put this man on."" It would"
"10443",140,"overcrowd his department and spoil the record he was trying to make--but"
"10444",140,"he said not a word except ""All right."""
"10445",140,""
"10446",140,"And so Jurgis became a workingman once more; and straightway he sought"
"10447",140,"out his old friends, and joined the union, and began to ""root"" for"
"10448",140,"""Scotty"" Doyle. Doyle had done him a good turn once, he explained,"
"10449",140,"and was really a bully chap; Doyle was a workingman himself, and would"
"10450",140,"represent the workingmen--why did they want to vote for a millionaire"
"10451",140,"""sheeny,"" and what the hell had Mike Scully ever done for them that they"
"10452",140,"should back his candidates all the time? And meantime Scully had given"
"10453",140,"Jurgis a note to the Republican leader of the ward, and he had gone"
"10454",140,"there and met the crowd he was to work with. Already they had hired"
"10455",140,"a big hall, with some of the brewer's money, and every night Jurgis"
"10456",140,"brought in a dozen new members of the ""Doyle Republican Association."""
"10457",140,"Pretty soon they had a grand opening night; and there was a brass band,"
"10458",140,"which marched through the streets, and fireworks and bombs and red"
"10459",140,"lights in front of the hall; and there was an enormous crowd, with"
"10460",140,"two overflow meetings--so that the pale and trembling candidate had to"
"10461",140,"recite three times over the little speech which one of Scully's henchmen"
"10462",140,"had written, and which he had been a month learning by heart. Best"
"10463",140,"of all, the famous and eloquent Senator Spareshanks, presidential"
"10464",140,"candidate, rode out in an automobile to discuss the sacred privileges"
"10465",140,"of American citizenship, and protection and prosperity for the American"
"10466",140,"workingman. His inspiriting address was quoted to the extent of half a"
"10467",140,"column in all the morning newspapers, which also said that it could be"
"10468",140,"stated upon excellent authority that the unexpected popularity developed"
"10469",140,"by Doyle, the Republican candidate for alderman, was giving great"
"10470",140,"anxiety to Mr. Scully, the chairman of the Democratic City Committee."
"10471",140,""
"10472",140,"The chairman was still more worried when the monster torchlight"
"10473",140,"procession came off, with the members of the Doyle Republican"
"10474",140,"Association all in red capes and hats, and free beer for every voter in"
"10475",140,"the ward--the best beer ever given away in a political campaign, as"
"10476",140,"the whole electorate testified. During this parade, and at innumerable"
"10477",140,"cart-tail meetings as well, Jurgis labored tirelessly. He did not make"
"10478",140,"any speeches--there were lawyers and other experts for that--but he"
"10479",140,"helped to manage things; distributing notices and posting placards and"
"10480",140,"bringing out the crowds; and when the show was on he attended to the"
"10481",140,"fireworks and the beer. Thus in the course of the campaign he handled"
"10482",140,"many hundreds of dollars of the Hebrew brewer's money, administering it"
"10483",140,"with naive and touching fidelity. Toward the end, however, he learned"
"10484",140,"that he was regarded with hatred by the rest of the ""boys,"" because he"
"10485",140,"compelled them either to make a poorer showing than he or to do without"
"10486",140,"their share of the pie. After that Jurgis did his best to please them,"
"10487",140,"and to make up for the time he had lost before he discovered the extra"
"10488",140,"bungholes of the campaign barrel."
"10489",140,""
"10490",140,"He pleased Mike Scully, also. On election morning he was out at four"
"10491",140,"o'clock, ""getting out the vote""; he had a two-horse carriage to ride in,"
"10492",140,"and he went from house to house for his friends, and escorted them in"
"10493",140,"triumph to the polls. He voted half a dozen times himself, and voted"
"10494",140,"some of his friends as often; he brought bunch after bunch of the newest"
"10495",140,"foreigners--Lithuanians, Poles, Bohemians, Slovaks--and when he had put"
"10496",140,"them through the mill he turned them over to another man to take to"
"10497",140,"the next polling place. When Jurgis first set out, the captain of the"
"10498",140,"precinct gave him a hundred dollars, and three times in the course of"
"10499",140,"the day he came for another hundred, and not more than twenty-five out"
"10500",140,"of each lot got stuck in his own pocket. The balance all went for actual"
"10501",140,"votes, and on a day of Democratic landslides they elected ""Scotty"""

"10503",140,"beginning at five o'clock in the afternoon, and ending at three the next"

"10505",140,"Nearly every one else in Packingtown did the same, however, for there"

"10518",140,"had nearly three hundred dollars in the bank, and might have considered"
"10519",140,"himself entitled to a vacation; but he had an easy job, and force of"
"10520",140,"habit kept him at it. Besides, Mike Scully, whom he consulted, advised"

"10530",140,"about eleven dollars a week, and two-thirds of it he might spend upon"
"10531",140,"his pleasures without ever touching his savings."
"10532",140,""
"10533",140,"Sometimes he would ride down-town with a party of friends to the cheap"
"10534",140,"theaters and the music halls and other haunts with which they were"
"10535",140,"familiar. Many of the saloons in Packingtown had pool tables, and some"
"10536",140,"of them bowling alleys, by means of which he could spend his evenings"
"10537",140,"in petty gambling. Also, there were cards and dice. One time Jurgis got"
"10538",140,"into a game on a Saturday night and won prodigiously, and because he was"
"10539",140,"a man of spirit he stayed in with the rest and the game continued"
"10540",140,"until late Sunday afternoon, and by that time he was ""out"" over twenty"
"10541",140,"dollars. On Saturday nights, also, a number of balls were generally"

"10543",140,"half a dollar for a ticket, and several dollars additional for drinks"
"10544",140,"in the course of the festivities, which continued until three or four"

"10551",140,"expired, and a new agreement had to be signed. Negotiations were going"
"10552",140,"on, and the yards were full of talk of a strike. The old scale had dealt"
"10553",140,"with the wages of the skilled men only; and of the members of the Meat"
"10554",140,"Workers' Union about two-thirds were unskilled men. In Chicago these"
"10555",140,"latter were receiving, for the most part, eighteen and a half cents an"
"10556",140,"hour, and the unions wished to make this the general wage for the next"
"10557",140,"year. It was not nearly so large a wage as it seemed--in the course of"
"10558",140,"the negotiations the union officers examined time checks to the amount"
"10559",140,"of ten thousand dollars, and they found that the highest wages paid had"
"10560",140,"been fourteen dollars a week, and the lowest two dollars and five cents,"
"10561",140,"and the average of the whole, six dollars and sixty-five cents. And six"
"10562",140,"dollars and sixty-five cents was hardly too much for a man to keep"
"10563",140,"a family on, considering the fact that the price of dressed meat had"
"10564",140,"increased nearly fifty per cent in the last five years, while the price"
"10565",140,"of ""beef on the hoof"" had decreased as much, it would have seemed that"
"10566",140,"the packers ought to be able to pay it; but the packers were unwilling"
"10567",140,"to pay it--they rejected the union demand, and to show what their"
"10568",140,"purpose was, a week or two after the agreement expired they put down the"
"10569",140,"wages of about a thousand men to sixteen and a half cents, and it was"
"10570",140,"said that old man Jones had vowed he would put them to fifteen before"
"10571",140,"he got through. There were a million and a half of men in the country"
"10572",140,"looking for work, a hundred thousand of them right in Chicago; and were"
"10573",140,"the packers to let the union stewards march into their places and bind"
"10574",140,"them to a contract that would lose them several thousand dollars a day"
"10575",140,"for a year? Not much!"
"10576",140,""
"10577",140,"All this was in June; and before long the question was submitted to a"
"10578",140,"referendum in the unions, and the decision was for a strike. It was the"
"10579",140,"same in all the packing house cities; and suddenly the newspapers and"
"10580",140,"public woke up to face the gruesome spectacle of a meat famine. All"
"10581",140,"sorts of pleas for a reconsideration were made, but the packers were"
"10582",140,"obdurate; and all the while they were reducing wages, and heading off"
"10583",140,"shipments of cattle, and rushing in wagon-loads of mattresses and cots."
"10584",140,"So the men boiled over, and one night telegrams went out from the union"
"10585",140,"headquarters to all the big packing centers--to St. Paul, South Omaha,"
"10586",140,"Sioux City, St. Joseph, Kansas City, East St. Louis, and New York--and"
"10587",140,"the next day at noon between fifty and sixty thousand men drew off their"

"10590",140,""
"10591",140,"Jurgis went to his dinner, and afterward he walked over to see Mike"
"10592",140,"Scully, who lived in a fine house, upon a street which had been decently"
"10593",140,"paved and lighted for his especial benefit. Scully had gone into"
"10594",140,"semi-retirement, and looked nervous and worried. ""What do you want?"" he"

"10599",140,""
"10600",140,"And Scully knit his brows and eyed him narrowly. In that morning's"
"10601",140,"papers Jurgis had read a fierce denunciation of the packers by Scully,"
"10602",140,"who had declared that if they did not treat their people better the"
"10603",140,"city authorities would end the matter by tearing down their plants. Now,"
"10604",140,"therefore, Jurgis was not a little taken aback when the other demanded"

"10611",140,"""But--but--"" stammered Jurgis. He had somehow taken it for granted that"
"10612",140,"he should go out with his union. ""The packers need good men, and need"
"10613",140,"them bad,"" continued the other, ""and they'll treat a man right that"

"10630",140,"""Yes,"" responded the other, ""but not right away; a man can't change his"
"10631",140,"politics every day. And besides, I don't need you--there'd be nothing"
"10632",140,"for you to do. And it's a long time to election day, anyhow; and what"
"10633",140,"are you going to do meantime?"""
"10634",140,""
"10635",140,"""I thought I could count on you,"" began Jurgis."
"10636",140,""
"10637",140,"""Yes,"" responded Scully, ""so you could--I never yet went back on a"
"10638",140,"friend. But is it fair to leave the job I got you and come to me for"
"10639",140,"another? I have had a hundred fellows after me today, and what can I"
"10640",140,"do? I've put seventeen men on the city payroll to clean streets this one"
"10641",140,"week, and do you think I can keep that up forever? It wouldn't do for"
"10642",140,"me to tell other men what I tell you, but you've been on the inside,"
"10643",140,"and you ought to have sense enough to see for yourself. What have you to"
"10644",140,"gain by a strike?"""

"10651",140,""
"10652",140,"And Jurgis saw. He went back to the yards, and into the workroom. The"

"10654",140,"the foreman was directing the feeble efforts of a score or two of clerks"
"10655",140,"and stenographers and office boys to finish up the job and get them into"
"10656",140,"the chilling rooms. Jurgis went straight up to him and announced, ""I"

"10659",140,"The boss's face lighted up. ""Good man!"" he cried. ""Come ahead!"""
"10660",140,""
"10661",140,"""Just a moment,"" said Jurgis, checking his enthusiasm. ""I think I ought"
"10662",140,"to get a little more wages."""

"10664",140,"""Yes,"" replied the other, ""of course. What do you want?"""

"10669",140,""
"10670",140,"""All right,"" said the other, promptly; and before the day was out our"
"10671",140,"friend discovered that the clerks and stenographers and office boys were"

"10673",140,""
"10674",140,""
"10675",140,"So Jurgis became one of the new ""American heroes,"" a man whose virtues"
"10676",140,"merited comparison with those of the martyrs of Lexington and Valley"
"10677",140,"Forge. The resemblance was not complete, of course, for Jurgis was"
"10678",140,"generously paid and comfortably clad, and was provided with a spring cot"
"10679",140,"and a mattress and three substantial meals a day; also he was perfectly"
"10680",140,"at ease, and safe from all peril of life and limb, save only in the"
"10681",140,"case that a desire for beer should lead him to venture outside of the"
"10682",140,"stockyards gates. And even in the exercise of this privilege he was not"
"10683",140,"left unprotected; a good part of the inadequate police force of Chicago"
"10684",140,"was suddenly diverted from its work of hunting criminals, and rushed out"
"10685",140,"to serve him. The police, and the strikers also, were determined that"
"10686",140,"there should be no violence; but there was another party interested"
"10687",140,"which was minded to the contrary--and that was the press. On the first"
"10688",140,"day of his life as a strikebreaker Jurgis quit work early, and in a"
"10689",140,"spirit of bravado he challenged three men of his acquaintance to go"
"10690",140,"outside and get a drink. They accepted, and went through the big Halsted"
"10691",140,"Street gate, where several policemen were watching, and also some union"
"10692",140,"pickets, scanning sharply those who passed in and out. Jurgis and"
"10693",140,"his companions went south on Halsted Street; past the hotel, and then"
"10694",140,"suddenly half a dozen men started across the street toward them and"
"10695",140,"proceeded to argue with them concerning the error of their ways. As the"
"10696",140,"arguments were not taken in the proper spirit, they went on to threats;"
"10697",140,"and suddenly one of them jerked off the hat of one of the four and"
"10698",140,"flung it over the fence. The man started after it, and then, as a cry"
"10699",140,"of ""Scab!"" was raised and a dozen people came running out of saloons and"
"10700",140,"doorways, a second man's heart failed him and he followed. Jurgis and"
"10701",140,"the fourth stayed long enough to give themselves the satisfaction of"
"10702",140,"a quick exchange of blows, and then they, too, took to their heels and"
"10703",140,"fled back of the hotel and into the yards again. Meantime, of course,"
"10704",140,"policemen were coming on a run, and as a crowd gathered other police got"
"10705",140,"excited and sent in a riot call. Jurgis knew nothing of this, but went"
"10706",140,"back to ""Packers' Avenue,"" and in front of the ""Central Time Station"""
"10707",140,"he saw one of his companions, breathless and wild with excitement,"
"10708",140,"narrating to an ever growing throng how the four had been attacked and"
"10709",140,"surrounded by a howling mob, and had been nearly torn to pieces. While"
"10710",140,"he stood listening, smiling cynically, several dapper young men stood by"
"10711",140,"with notebooks in their hands, and it was not more than two hours later"
"10712",140,"that Jurgis saw newsboys running about with armfuls of newspapers,"
"10713",140,"printed in red and black letters six inches high:"
"10714",140,""

"10716",140,""
"10717",140,"If he had been able to buy all of the newspapers of the United States"
"10718",140,"the next morning, he might have discovered that his beer-hunting exploit"
"10719",140,"was being perused by some two score millions of people, and had served"
"10720",140,"as a text for editorials in half the staid and solemn business-men's"
"10721",140,"newspapers in the land."
"10722",140,""
"10723",140,"Jurgis was to see more of this as time passed. For the present, his work"
"10724",140,"being over, he was free to ride into the city, by a railroad direct from"
"10725",140,"the yards, or else to spend the night in a room where cots had been"
"10726",140,"laid in rows. He chose the latter, but to his regret, for all night long"
"10727",140,"gangs of strikebreakers kept arriving. As very few of the better class"
"10728",140,"of workingmen could be got for such work, these specimens of the new"
"10729",140,"American hero contained an assortment of the criminals and thugs of"
"10730",140,"the city, besides Negroes and the lowest foreigners--Greeks, Roumanians,"
"10731",140,"Sicilians, and Slovaks. They had been attracted more by the prospect of"
"10732",140,"disorder than by the big wages; and they made the night hideous with"
"10733",140,"singing and carousing, and only went to sleep when the time came for"

"10744",140,"been left most in the lurch, and precisely here that they could least"
"10745",140,"afford it; the smoking and canning and salting of meat might wait, and"
"10746",140,"all the by-products might be wasted--but fresh meats must be had, or the"
"10747",140,"restaurants and hotels and brownstone houses would feel the pinch, and"
"10748",140,"then ""public opinion"" would take a startling turn."
"10749",140,""
"10750",140,"An opportunity such as this would not come twice to a man; and Jurgis"
"10751",140,"seized it. Yes, he knew the work, the whole of it, and he could teach it"
"10752",140,"to others. But if he took the job and gave satisfaction he would expect"
"10753",140,"to keep it--they would not turn him off at the end of the strike? To"
"10754",140,"which the superintendent replied that he might safely trust Durham's"
"10755",140,"for that--they proposed to teach these unions a lesson, and most of"
"10756",140,"all those foremen who had gone back on them. Jurgis would receive five"
"10757",140,"dollars a day during the strike, and twenty-five a week after it was"
"10758",140,"settled."
"10759",140,""
"10760",140,"So our friend got a pair of ""slaughter pen"" boots and ""jeans,"" and flung"
"10761",140,"himself at his task. It was a weird sight, there on the killing beds--a"
"10762",140,"throng of stupid black Negroes, and foreigners who could not understand"
"10763",140,"a word that was said to them, mixed with pale-faced, hollow-chested"
"10764",140,"bookkeepers and clerks, half-fainting for the tropical heat and the"
"10765",140,"sickening stench of fresh blood--and all struggling to dress a dozen"
"10766",140,"or two cattle in the same place where, twenty-four hours ago, the old"
"10767",140,"killing gang had been speeding, with their marvelous precision, turning"
"10768",140,"out four hundred carcasses every hour!"
"10769",140,""
"10770",140,"The Negroes and the ""toughs"" from the Levee did not want to work,"
"10771",140,"and every few minutes some of them would feel obliged to retire and"
"10772",140,"recuperate. In a couple of days Durham and Company had electric fans up"
"10773",140,"to cool off the rooms for them, and even couches for them to rest"
"10774",140,"on; and meantime they could go out and find a shady corner and take a"
"10775",140,"""snooze,"" and as there was no place for any one in particular, and no"
"10776",140,"system, it might be hours before their boss discovered them. As for"
"10777",140,"the poor office employees, they did their best, moved to it by terror;"
"10778",140,"thirty of them had been ""fired"" in a bunch that first morning for"
"10779",140,"refusing to serve, besides a number of women clerks and typewriters who"
"10780",140,"had declined to act as waitresses."
"10781",140,""
"10782",140,"It was such a force as this that Jurgis had to organize. He did his"
"10783",140,"best, flying here and there, placing them in rows and showing them the"
"10784",140,"tricks; he had never given an order in his life before, but he had taken"
"10785",140,"enough of them to know, and he soon fell into the spirit of it, and"
"10786",140,"roared and stormed like any old stager. He had not the most tractable"
"10787",140,"pupils, however. ""See hyar, boss,"" a big black ""buck"" would begin, ""ef"
"10788",140,"you doan' like de way Ah does dis job, you kin get somebody else to do"
"10789",140,"it."" Then a crowd would gather and listen, muttering threats. After the"
"10790",140,"first meal nearly all the steel knives had been missing, and now every"
"10791",140,"Negro had one, ground to a fine point, hidden in his boots."
"10792",140,""
"10793",140,"There was no bringing order out of such a chaos, Jurgis soon discovered;"
"10794",140,"and he fell in with the spirit of the thing--there was no reason why he"
"10795",140,"should wear himself out with shouting. If hides and guts were slashed"
"10796",140,"and rendered useless there was no way of tracing it to any one; and if"
"10797",140,"a man lay off and forgot to come back there was nothing to be gained"
"10798",140,"by seeking him, for all the rest would quit in the meantime. Everything"
"10799",140,"went, during the strike, and the packers paid. Before long Jurgis"
"10800",140,"found that the custom of resting had suggested to some alert minds the"
"10801",140,"possibility of registering at more than one place and earning more than"
"10802",140,"one five dollars a day. When he caught a man at this he ""fired"" him,"
"10803",140,"but it chanced to be in a quiet corner, and the man tendered him a"
"10804",140,"ten-dollar bill and a wink, and he took them. Of course, before long"
"10805",140,"this custom spread, and Jurgis was soon making quite a good income from"
"10806",140,"it."
"10807",140,""
"10808",140,"In the face of handicaps such as these the packers counted themselves"
"10809",140,"lucky if they could kill off the cattle that had been crippled in"
"10810",140,"transit and the hogs that had developed disease. Frequently, in the"
"10811",140,"course of a two or three days' trip, in hot weather and without water,"
"10812",140,"some hog would develop cholera, and die; and the rest would attack him"
"10813",140,"before he had ceased kicking, and when the car was opened there would be"
"10814",140,"nothing of him left but the bones. If all the hogs in this carload were"
"10815",140,"not killed at once, they would soon be down with the dread disease, and"
"10816",140,"there would be nothing to do but make them into lard. It was the same"
"10817",140,"with cattle that were gored and dying, or were limping with broken bones"
"10818",140,"stuck through their flesh--they must be killed, even if brokers and"
"10819",140,"buyers and superintendents had to take off their coats and help"
"10820",140,"drive and cut and skin them. And meantime, agents of the packers were"
"10821",140,"gathering gangs of Negroes in the country districts of the far South,"
"10822",140,"promising them five dollars a day and board, and being careful not to"
"10823",140,"mention there was a strike; already carloads of them were on the way,"
"10824",140,"with special rates from the railroads, and all traffic ordered out of"
"10825",140,"the way. Many towns and cities were taking advantage of the chance to"
"10826",140,"clear out their jails and workhouses--in Detroit the magistrates would"
"10827",140,"release every man who agreed to leave town within twenty-four hours,"
"10828",140,"and agents of the packers were in the courtrooms to ship them right. And"
"10829",140,"meantime trainloads of supplies were coming in for their accommodation,"
"10830",140,"including beer and whisky, so that they might not be tempted to go"
"10831",140,"outside. They hired thirty young girls in Cincinnati to ""pack fruit,"""
"10832",140,"and when they arrived put them at work canning corned beef, and put cots"
"10833",140,"for them to sleep in a public hallway, through which the men passed. As"
"10834",140,"the gangs came in day and night, under the escort of squads of police,"
"10835",140,"they stowed away in unused workrooms and storerooms, and in the car"
"10836",140,"sheds, crowded so closely together that the cots touched. In some places"
"10837",140,"they would use the same room for eating and sleeping, and at night the"
"10838",140,"men would put their cots upon the tables, to keep away from the swarms"
"10839",140,"of rats."
"10840",140,""
"10841",140,"But with all their best efforts, the packers were demoralized."
"10842",140,"Ninety per cent of the men had walked out; and they faced the task of"
"10843",140,"completely remaking their labor force--and with the price of meat up"
"10844",140,"thirty per cent, and the public clamoring for a settlement. They made an"
"10845",140,"offer to submit the whole question at issue to arbitration; and at the"
"10846",140,"end of ten days the unions accepted it, and the strike was called off."
"10847",140,"It was agreed that all the men were to be re-employed within forty-five"
"10848",140,"days, and that there was to be ""no discrimination against union men."""
"10849",140,""
"10850",140,"This was an anxious time for Jurgis. If the men were taken back ""without"
"10851",140,"discrimination,"" he would lose his present place. He sought out the"
"10852",140,"superintendent, who smiled grimly and bade him ""wait and see."" Durham's"
"10853",140,"strikebreakers were few of them leaving."
"10854",140,""
"10855",140,"Whether or not the ""settlement"" was simply a trick of the packers to"
"10856",140,"gain time, or whether they really expected to break the strike and"
"10857",140,"cripple the unions by the plan, cannot be said; but that night there"
"10858",140,"went out from the office of Durham and Company a telegram to all the big"
"10859",140,"packing centers, ""Employ no union leaders."" And in the morning, when the"
"10860",140,"twenty thousand men thronged into the yards, with their dinner pails and"
"10861",140,"working clothes, Jurgis stood near the door of the hog-trimming room,"
"10862",140,"where he had worked before the strike, and saw a throng of eager"
"10863",140,"men, with a score or two of policemen watching them; and he saw a"
"10864",140,"superintendent come out and walk down the line, and pick out man after"
"10865",140,"man that pleased him; and one after another came, and there were some"
"10866",140,"men up near the head of the line who were never picked--they being"
"10867",140,"the union stewards and delegates, and the men Jurgis had heard making"
"10868",140,"speeches at the meetings. Each time, of course, there were louder"
"10869",140,"murmurings and angrier looks. Over where the cattle butchers were"
"10870",140,"waiting, Jurgis heard shouts and saw a crowd, and he hurried there. One"
"10871",140,"big butcher, who was president of the Packing Trades Council, had been"
"10872",140,"passed over five times, and the men were wild with rage; they had"
"10873",140,"appointed a committee of three to go in and see the superintendent, and"
"10874",140,"the committee had made three attempts, and each time the police had"
"10875",140,"clubbed them back from the door. Then there were yells and hoots,"
"10876",140,"continuing until at last the superintendent came to the door. ""We all go"
"10877",140,"back or none of us do!"" cried a hundred voices. And the other shook his"
"10878",140,"fist at them, and shouted, ""You went out of here like cattle, and like"
"10879",140,"cattle you'll come back!"""
"10880",140,""
"10881",140,"Then suddenly the big butcher president leaped upon a pile of stones and"
"10882",140,"yelled: ""It's off, boys. We'll all of us quit again!"" And so the cattle"
"10883",140,"butchers declared a new strike on the spot; and gathering their members"
"10884",140,"from the other plants, where the same trick had been played, they"
"10885",140,"marched down Packers' Avenue, which was thronged with a dense mass of"
"10886",140,"workers, cheering wildly. Men who had already got to work on the killing"
"10887",140,"beds dropped their tools and joined them; some galloped here and there"
"10888",140,"on horseback, shouting the tidings, and within half an hour the whole of"
"10889",140,"Packingtown was on strike again, and beside itself with fury."
"10890",140,""
"10891",140,"There was quite a different tone in Packingtown after this--the place"
"10892",140,"was a seething caldron of passion, and the ""scab"" who ventured into"
"10893",140,"it fared badly. There were one or two of these incidents each day, the"
"10894",140,"newspapers detailing them, and always blaming them upon the unions. Yet"
"10895",140,"ten years before, when there were no unions in Packingtown, there was"
"10896",140,"a strike, and national troops had to be called, and there were pitched"
"10897",140,"battles fought at night, by the light of blazing freight trains."
"10898",140,"Packingtown was always a center of violence; in ""Whisky Point,"" where"
"10899",140,"there were a hundred saloons and one glue factory, there was always"
"10900",140,"fighting, and always more of it in hot weather. Any one who had taken"
"10901",140,"the trouble to consult the station house blotter would have found that"
"10902",140,"there was less violence that summer than ever before--and this while"
"10903",140,"twenty thousand men were out of work, and with nothing to do all day"
"10904",140,"but brood upon bitter wrongs. There was no one to picture the battle the"
"10905",140,"union leaders were fighting--to hold this huge army in rank, to keep"
"10906",140,"it from straggling and pillaging, to cheer and encourage and guide a"
"10907",140,"hundred thousand people, of a dozen different tongues, through six long"
"10908",140,"weeks of hunger and disappointment and despair."
"10909",140,""
"10910",140,"Meantime the packers had set themselves definitely to the task of making"
"10911",140,"a new labor force. A thousand or two of strikebreakers were brought in"
"10912",140,"every night, and distributed among the various plants. Some of them were"
"10913",140,"experienced workers,--butchers, salesmen, and managers from the packers'"
"10914",140,"branch stores, and a few union men who had deserted from other cities;"
"10915",140,"but the vast majority were ""green"" Negroes from the cotton districts of"
"10916",140,"the far South, and they were herded into the packing plants like sheep."
"10917",140,"There was a law forbidding the use of buildings as lodging-houses unless"
"10918",140,"they were licensed for the purpose, and provided with proper windows,"
"10919",140,"stairways, and fire escapes; but here, in a ""paint room,"" reached only"
"10920",140,"by an enclosed ""chute,"" a room without a single window and only one"
"10921",140,"door, a hundred men were crowded upon mattresses on the floor. Up on"
"10922",140,"the third story of the ""hog house"" of Jones's was a storeroom, without"
"10923",140,"a window, into which they crowded seven hundred men, sleeping upon the"
"10924",140,"bare springs of cots, and with a second shift to use them by day."
"10925",140,"And when the clamor of the public led to an investigation into"
"10926",140,"these conditions, and the mayor of the city was forced to order the"
"10927",140,"enforcement of the law, the packers got a judge to issue an injunction"
"10928",140,"forbidding him to do it!"
"10929",140,""
"10930",140,"Just at this time the mayor was boasting that he had put an end"
"10931",140,"to gambling and prize fighting in the city; but here a swarm of"
"10932",140,"professional gamblers had leagued themselves with the police to fleece"
"10933",140,"the strikebreakers; and any night, in the big open space in front of"
"10934",140,"Brown's, one might see brawny Negroes stripped to the waist and pounding"
"10935",140,"each other for money, while a howling throng of three or four thousand"
"10936",140,"surged about, men and women, young white girls from the country rubbing"
"10937",140,"elbows with big buck Negroes with daggers in their boots, while rows of"
"10938",140,"woolly heads peered down from every window of the surrounding factories."
"10939",140,"The ancestors of these black people had been savages in Africa; and"
"10940",140,"since then they had been chattel slaves, or had been held down by a"
"10941",140,"community ruled by the traditions of slavery. Now for the first time"
"10942",140,"they were free--free to gratify every passion, free to wreck themselves."
"10943",140,"They were wanted to break a strike, and when it was broken they would be"
"10944",140,"shipped away, and their present masters would never see them again; and"
"10945",140,"so whisky and women were brought in by the carload and sold to them, and"
"10946",140,"hell was let loose in the yards. Every night there were stabbings and"
"10947",140,"shootings; it was said that the packers had blank permits, which"
"10948",140,"enabled them to ship dead bodies from the city without troubling the"
"10949",140,"authorities. They lodged men and women on the same floor; and with"
"10950",140,"the night there began a saturnalia of debauchery--scenes such as never"
"10951",140,"before had been witnessed in America. And as the women were the dregs"
"10952",140,"from the brothels of Chicago, and the men were for the most part"
"10953",140,"ignorant country Negroes, the nameless diseases of vice were soon rife;"
"10954",140,"and this where food was being handled which was sent out to every corner"
"10955",140,"of the civilized world."
"10956",140,""
"10957",140,"The ""Union Stockyards"" were never a pleasant place; but now they were"
"10958",140,"not only a collection of slaughterhouses, but also the camping place"
"10959",140,"of an army of fifteen or twenty thousand human beasts. All day long the"
"10960",140,"blazing midsummer sun beat down upon that square mile of abominations:"
"10961",140,"upon tens of thousands of cattle crowded into pens whose wooden floors"
"10962",140,"stank and steamed contagion; upon bare, blistering, cinder-strewn"
"10963",140,"railroad tracks, and huge blocks of dingy meat factories, whose"
"10964",140,"labyrinthine passages defied a breath of fresh air to penetrate them;"
"10965",140,"and there were not merely rivers of hot blood, and car-loads of"
"10966",140,"moist flesh, and rendering vats and soap caldrons, glue factories and"
"10967",140,"fertilizer tanks, that smelt like the craters of hell--there were also"
"10968",140,"tons of garbage festering in the sun, and the greasy laundry of the"
"10969",140,"workers hung out to dry, and dining rooms littered with food and black"
"10970",140,"with flies, and toilet rooms that were open sewers."
"10971",140,""
"10972",140,"And then at night, when this throng poured out into the streets to"
"10973",140,"play--fighting, gambling, drinking and carousing, cursing and screaming,"
"10974",140,"laughing and singing, playing banjoes and dancing! They were worked"
"10975",140,"in the yards all the seven days of the week, and they had their prize"
"10976",140,"fights and crap games on Sunday nights as well; but then around the"
"10977",140,"corner one might see a bonfire blazing, and an old, gray-headed Negress,"
"10978",140,"lean and witchlike, her hair flying wild and her eyes blazing, yelling"
"10979",140,"and chanting of the fires of perdition and the blood of the ""Lamb,"""
"10980",140,"while men and women lay down upon the ground and moaned and screamed in"
"10981",140,"convulsions of terror and remorse."
"10982",140,""
"10983",140,"Such were the stockyards during the strike; while the unions watched"
"10984",140,"in sullen despair, and the country clamored like a greedy child for its"
"10985",140,"food, and the packers went grimly on their way. Each day they added new"
"10986",140,"workers, and could be more stern with the old ones--could put them on"
"10987",140,"piecework, and dismiss them if they did not keep up the pace. Jurgis was"
"10988",140,"now one of their agents in this process; and he could feel the change"
"10989",140,"day by day, like the slow starting up of a huge machine. He had gotten"
"10990",140,"used to being a master of men; and because of the stifling heat and"
"10991",140,"the stench, and the fact that he was a ""scab"" and knew it and despised"
"10992",140,"himself. He was drinking, and developing a villainous temper, and he"
"10993",140,"stormed and cursed and raged at his men, and drove them until they were"
"10994",140,"ready to drop with exhaustion."
"10995",140,""
"10996",140,""
"10997",140,"Then one day late in August, a superintendent ran into the place"
"10998",140,"and shouted to Jurgis and his gang to drop their work and come. They"
"10999",140,"followed him outside, to where, in the midst of a dense throng, they"
"11000",140,"saw several two-horse trucks waiting, and three patrol-wagon loads of"
"11001",140,"police. Jurgis and his men sprang upon one of the trucks, and the driver"
"11002",140,"yelled to the crowd, and they went thundering away at a gallop. Some"
"11003",140,"steers had just escaped from the yards, and the strikers had got hold of"
"11004",140,"them, and there would be the chance of a scrap!"
"11005",140,""
"11006",140,"They went out at the Ashland Avenue gate, and over in the direction of"
"11007",140,"the ""dump."" There was a yell as soon as they were sighted, men and women"
"11008",140,"rushing out of houses and saloons as they galloped by. There were eight"
"11009",140,"or ten policemen on the truck, however, and there was no disturbance"
"11010",140,"until they came to a place where the street was blocked with a dense"
"11011",140,"throng. Those on the flying truck yelled a warning and the crowd"
"11012",140,"scattered pell-mell, disclosing one of the steers lying in its blood."
"11013",140,"There were a good many cattle butchers about just then, with nothing"
"11014",140,"much to do, and hungry children at home; and so some one had knocked out"
"11015",140,"the steer--and as a first-class man can kill and dress one in a couple"
"11016",140,"of minutes, there were a good many steaks and roasts already missing."
"11017",140,"This called for punishment, of course; and the police proceeded to"
"11018",140,"administer it by leaping from the truck and cracking at every head they"
"11019",140,"saw. There were yells of rage and pain, and the terrified people fled"
"11020",140,"into houses and stores, or scattered helter-skelter down the street."
"11021",140,"Jurgis and his gang joined in the sport, every man singling out his"
"11022",140,"victim, and striving to bring him to bay and punch him. If he fled into"
"11023",140,"a house his pursuer would smash in the flimsy door and follow him up the"
"11024",140,"stairs, hitting every one who came within reach, and finally dragging"
"11025",140,"his squealing quarry from under a bed or a pile of old clothes in a"
"11026",140,"closet."
"11027",140,""
"11028",140,"Jurgis and two policemen chased some men into a bar-room. One of"
"11029",140,"them took shelter behind the bar, where a policeman cornered him and"
"11030",140,"proceeded to whack him over the back and shoulders, until he lay down"
"11031",140,"and gave a chance at his head. The others leaped a fence in the rear,"
"11032",140,"balking the second policeman, who was fat; and as he came back, furious"
"11033",140,"and cursing, a big Polish woman, the owner of the saloon, rushed in"
"11034",140,"screaming, and received a poke in the stomach that doubled her up on"
"11035",140,"the floor. Meantime Jurgis, who was of a practical temper, was helping"
"11036",140,"himself at the bar; and the first policeman, who had laid out his man,"
"11037",140,"joined him, handing out several more bottles, and filling his pockets"
"11038",140,"besides, and then, as he started to leave, cleaning off all the balance"
"11039",140,"with a sweep of his club. The din of the glass crashing to the floor"
"11040",140,"brought the fat Polish woman to her feet again, but another policeman"
"11041",140,"came up behind her and put his knee into her back and his hands over her"
"11042",140,"eyes--and then called to his companion, who went back and broke open"
"11043",140,"the cash drawer and filled his pockets with the contents. Then the three"
"11044",140,"went outside, and the man who was holding the woman gave her a shove and"
"11045",140,"dashed out himself. The gang having already got the carcass on to the"
"11046",140,"truck, the party set out at a trot, followed by screams and curses,"
"11047",140,"and a shower of bricks and stones from unseen enemies. These bricks and"
"11048",140,"stones would figure in the accounts of the ""riot"" which would be sent"
"11049",140,"out to a few thousand newspapers within an hour or two; but the episode"
"11050",140,"of the cash drawer would never be mentioned again, save only in the"
"11051",140,"heartbreaking legends of Packingtown."

"11053",140,""
"11054",140,"It was late in the afternoon when they got back, and they dressed out"
"11055",140,"the remainder of the steer, and a couple of others that had been killed,"
"11056",140,"and then knocked off for the day. Jurgis went downtown to supper, with"
"11057",140,"three friends who had been on the other trucks, and they exchanged"
"11058",140,"reminiscences on the way. Afterward they drifted into a roulette parlor,"
"11059",140,"and Jurgis, who was never lucky at gambling, dropped about fifteen"
"11060",140,"dollars. To console himself he had to drink a good deal, and he went"
"11061",140,"back to Packingtown about two o'clock in the morning, very much the"
"11062",140,"worse for his excursion, and, it must be confessed, entirely deserving"
"11063",140,"the calamity that was in store for him."
"11064",140,""
"11065",140,"As he was going to the place where he slept, he met a painted-cheeked"
"11066",140,"woman in a greasy ""kimono,"" and she put her arm about his waist to"
"11067",140,"steady him; they turned into a dark room they were passing--but scarcely"
"11068",140,"had they taken two steps before suddenly a door swung open, and a man"
"11069",140,"entered, carrying a lantern. ""Who's there?"" he called sharply. And"
"11070",140,"Jurgis started to mutter some reply; but at the same instant the man"
"11071",140,"raised his light, which flashed in his face, so that it was possible"
"11072",140,"to recognize him. Jurgis stood stricken dumb, and his heart gave a leap"
"11073",140,"like a mad thing. The man was Connor!"
"11074",140,""
"11075",140,"Connor, the boss of the loading gang! The man who had seduced his"
"11076",140,"wife--who had sent him to prison, and wrecked his home, ruined his life!"

"11078",140,""
"11079",140,"Jurgis had often thought of Connor since coming back to Packingtown, but"
"11080",140,"it had been as of something far off, that no longer concerned him."
"11081",140,"Now, however, when he saw him, alive and in the flesh, the same thing"
"11082",140,"happened to him that had happened before--a flood of rage boiled up in"
"11083",140,"him, a blind frenzy seized him. And he flung himself at the man, and"
"11084",140,"smote him between the eyes--and then, as he fell, seized him by the"
"11085",140,"throat and began to pound his head upon the stones."

"11089",140,"thing; but they could hear Jurgis panting, and hear the thumping of"
"11090",140,"his victim's skull, and they rushed there and tried to pull him off."
"11091",140,"Precisely as before, Jurgis came away with a piece of his enemy's flesh"
"11092",140,"between his teeth; and, as before, he went on fighting with those who"
"11093",140,"had interfered with him, until a policeman had come and beaten him into"
"11094",140,"insensibility."
"11095",140,""
"11096",140,""
"11097",140,"And so Jurgis spent the balance of the night in the stockyards station"
"11098",140,"house. This time, however, he had money in his pocket, and when he came"
"11099",140,"to his senses he could get something to drink, and also a messenger"
"11100",140,"to take word of his plight to ""Bush"" Harper. Harper did not appear,"
"11101",140,"however, until after the prisoner, feeling very weak and ill, had been"
"11102",140,"hailed into court and remanded at five hundred dollars' bail to await"
"11103",140,"the result of his victim's injuries. Jurgis was wild about this, because"
"11104",140,"a different magistrate had chanced to be on the bench, and he had"
"11105",140,"stated that he had never been arrested before, and also that he had been"
"11106",140,"attacked first--and if only someone had been there to speak a good word"

"11147",140,"That was a pretty mess, indeed. Poor Jurgis sat half-dazed. His pull had"

"11156",140,""
"11157",140,"""But what good would that do you when you came to stand trial?"" asked"
"11158",140,"Harper. Then he sat buried in thought for a minute or two. ""There's"
"11159",140,"nothing--unless it's this,"" he said. ""I could have your bail reduced;"
"11160",140,"and then if you had the money you could pay it and skip."""
"11161",140,""
"11162",140,"""How much will it be?"" Jurgis asked, after he had had this explained"

"11171",140,"you sent to state's prison for a year or two."""
"11172",140,""
"11173",140,"And so finally Jurgis ripped out his bankbook--which was sewed up in his"
"11174",140,"trousers--and signed an order, which ""Bush"" Harper wrote, for all the"
"11175",140,"money to be paid out. Then the latter went and got it, and hurried to"
"11176",140,"the court, and explained to the magistrate that Jurgis was a"
"11177",140,"decent fellow and a friend of Scully's, who had been attacked by a"
"11178",140,"strike-breaker. So the bail was reduced to three hundred dollars, and"
"11179",140,"Harper went on it himself; he did not tell this to Jurgis, however--nor"
"11180",140,"did he tell him that when the time for trial came it would be an easy"
"11181",140,"matter for him to avoid the forfeiting of the bail, and pocket the three"
"11182",140,"hundred dollars as his reward for the risk of offending Mike Scully! All"
"11183",140,"that he told Jurgis was that he was now free, and that the best thing"
"11184",140,"he could do was to clear out as quickly as possible; and so Jurgis"
"11185",140,"overwhelmed with gratitude and relief, took the dollar and fourteen"
"11186",140,"cents that was left him out of all his bank account, and put it with the"
"11187",140,"two dollars and quarter that was left from his last night's celebration,"

"11194",140,"Poor Jurgis was now an outcast and a tramp once more. He was"
"11195",140,"crippled--he was as literally crippled as any wild animal which has lost"
"11196",140,"its claws, or been torn out of its shell. He had been shorn, at one"
"11197",140,"cut, of all those mysterious weapons whereby he had been able to make a"
"11198",140,"living easily and to escape the consequences of his actions. He could"
"11199",140,"no longer command a job when he wanted it; he could no longer steal with"
"11200",140,"impunity--he must take his chances with the common herd. Nay worse, he"
"11201",140,"dared not mingle with the herd--he must hide himself, for he was one"
"11202",140,"marked out for destruction. His old companions would betray him, for the"

"11207",140,"and Duane."
"11208",140,""
"11209",140,"And also he labored under another handicap now. He had acquired new"

"11212",140,"doorway or under a truck out of the rain, and if he could get fifteen"
"11213",140,"cents a day for saloon lunches. But now he desired all sorts of other"
"11214",140,"things, and suffered because he had to do without them. He must have a"
"11215",140,"drink now and then, a drink for its own sake, and apart from the food"
"11216",140,"that came with it. The craving for it was strong enough to master every"
"11217",140,"other consideration--he would have it, though it were his last nickel"
"11218",140,"and he had to starve the balance of the day in consequence."
"11219",140,""
"11220",140,"Jurgis became once more a besieger of factory gates. But never since he"
"11221",140,"had been in Chicago had he stood less chance of getting a job than just"
"11222",140,"then. For one thing, there was the economic crisis, the million or two"
"11223",140,"of men who had been out of work in the spring and summer, and were not"
"11224",140,"yet all back, by any means. And then there was the strike, with seventy"
"11225",140,"thousand men and women all over the country idle for a couple of"
"11226",140,"months--twenty thousand in Chicago, and many of them now seeking work"
"11227",140,"throughout the city. It did not remedy matters that a few days later the"
"11228",140,"strike was given up and about half the strikers went back to work; for"
"11229",140,"every one taken on, there was a ""scab"" who gave up and fled. The ten"
"11230",140,"or fifteen thousand ""green"" Negroes, foreigners, and criminals were now"
"11231",140,"being turned loose to shift for themselves. Everywhere Jurgis went he"
"11232",140,"kept meeting them, and he was in an agony of fear lest some one of them"
"11233",140,"should know that he was ""wanted."" He would have left Chicago, only by"
"11234",140,"the time he had realized his danger he was almost penniless; and it"
"11235",140,"would be better to go to jail than to be caught out in the country in"
"11236",140,"the winter time."
"11237",140,""
"11238",140,"At the end of about ten days Jurgis had only a few pennies left; and he"
"11239",140,"had not yet found a job--not even a day's work at anything, not a chance"
"11240",140,"to carry a satchel. Once again, as when he had come out of the hospital,"
"11241",140,"he was bound hand and foot, and facing the grisly phantom of starvation."
"11242",140,"Raw, naked terror possessed him, a maddening passion that would never"
"11243",140,"leave him, and that wore him down more quickly than the actual want of"
"11244",140,"food. He was going to die of hunger! The fiend reached out its scaly"
"11245",140,"arms for him--it touched him, its breath came into his face; and he"
"11246",140,"would cry out for the awfulness of it, he would wake up in the night,"
"11247",140,"shuddering, and bathed in perspiration, and start up and flee. He would"
"11248",140,"walk, begging for work, until he was exhausted; he could not remain"
"11249",140,"still--he would wander on, gaunt and haggard, gazing about him with"
"11250",140,"restless eyes. Everywhere he went, from one end of the vast city to the"
"11251",140,"other, there were hundreds of others like him; everywhere was the sight"
"11252",140,"of plenty and the merciless hand of authority waving them away. There is"
"11253",140,"one kind of prison where the man is behind bars, and everything that"
"11254",140,"he desires is outside; and there is another kind where the things are"
"11255",140,"behind the bars, and the man is outside."

"11257",140,"When he was down to his last quarter, Jurgis learned that before the"

"11260",140,"and break them up and stuff his pockets with them, munching a bit from"
"11261",140,"time to time. He would not spend a penny save for this; and, after two"

"11263",140,"and peer into the ash barrels as he walked along the streets, and now"

"11269",140,"experience, that almost broke his heart. He was passing down a street"
"11270",140,"lined with warehouses, and a boss offered him a job, and then, after he"
"11271",140,"had started to work, turned him off because he was not strong enough."
"11272",140,"And he stood by and saw another man put into his place, and then picked"
"11273",140,"up his coat, and walked off, doing all that he could to keep from"
"11274",140,"breaking down and crying like a baby. He was lost! He was doomed! There"
"11275",140,"was no hope for him! But then, with a sudden rush, his fear gave place"
"11276",140,"to rage. He fell to cursing. He would come back there after dark, and he"
"11277",140,"would show that scoundrel whether he was good for anything or not!"
"11278",140,""
"11279",140,"He was still muttering this when suddenly, at the corner, he came upon"
"11280",140,"a green-grocery, with a tray full of cabbages in front of it. Jurgis,"
"11281",140,"after one swift glance about him, stooped and seized the biggest of"
"11282",140,"them, and darted round the corner with it. There was a hue and cry,"

"11284",140,"alley, and then to another branching off from it and leading him into"
"11285",140,"another street, where he fell into a walk, and slipped his cabbage under"
"11286",140,"his coat and went off unsuspected in the crowd. When he had gotten"
"11287",140,"a safe distance away he sat down and devoured half the cabbage raw,"
"11288",140,"stowing the balance away in his pockets till the next day."

"11290",140,"Just about this time one of the Chicago newspapers, which made much of"

"11293",140,"advertising it gave them, and some others said that their motive was"
"11294",140,"a fear lest all their readers should be starved off; but whatever the"
"11295",140,"reason, the soup was thick and hot, and there was a bowl for every man,"

"11297",140,"vowed that he would have half a dozen bowls before morning; but, as it"
"11298",140,"proved, he was lucky to get one, for there was a line of men two blocks"

"11305",140,"of refuge. So far the weather had been fair, and he had slept out every"

"11307",140,"advancing winter, a chill wind from the north and a driving storm of"

"11319",140,"the voters of the country would select a President; and he heard the"
"11320",140,"wretches with whom he associated discussing it, and saw the streets"

"11337",140,"The campaign had so far been characterized by what the newspapers termed"
"11338",140,"""apathy."" For some reason the people refused to get excited over the"
"11339",140,"struggle, and it was almost impossible to get them to come to meetings,"
"11340",140,"or to make any noise when they did come. Those which had been held in"
"11341",140,"Chicago so far had proven most dismal failures, and tonight, the speaker"
"11342",140,"being no less a personage than a candidate for the vice-presidency of"
"11343",140,"the nation, the political managers had been trembling with anxiety. But"
"11344",140,"a merciful providence had sent this storm of cold rain--and now all it"
"11345",140,"was necessary to do was to set off a few fireworks, and thump awhile on"
"11346",140,"a drum, and all the homeless wretches from a mile around would pour in"
"11347",140,"and fill the hall! And then on the morrow the newspapers would have a"
"11348",140,"chance to report the tremendous ovation, and to add that it had been no"
"11349",140,"""silk-stocking"" audience, either, proving clearly that the high"
"11350",140,"tariff sentiments of the distinguished candidate were pleasing to the"
"11351",140,"wage-earners of the nation."
"11352",140,""
"11353",140,"So Jurgis found himself in a large hall, elaborately decorated with"
"11354",140,"flags and bunting; and after the chairman had made his little speech,"
"11355",140,"and the orator of the evening rose up, amid an uproar from the"
"11356",140,"band--only fancy the emotions of Jurgis upon making the discovery"
"11357",140,"that the personage was none other than the famous and eloquent Senator"
"11358",140,"Spareshanks, who had addressed the ""Doyle Republican Association"" at"
"11359",140,"the stockyards, and helped to elect Mike Scully's tenpin setter to the"
"11360",140,"Chicago Board of Aldermen!"
"11361",140,""
"11362",140,"In truth, the sight of the senator almost brought the tears into"
"11363",140,"Jurgis's eyes. What agony it was to him to look back upon those golden"
"11364",140,"hours, when he, too, had a place beneath the shadow of the plum tree!"
"11365",140,"When he, too, had been of the elect, through whom the country is"
"11366",140,"governed--when he had had a bung in the campaign barrel for his own! And"
"11367",140,"this was another election in which the Republicans had all the money;"
"11368",140,"and but for that one hideous accident he might have had a share of it,"
"11369",140,"instead of being where he was!"
"11370",140,""
"11371",140,""
"11372",140,"The eloquent senator was explaining the system of protection; an"
"11373",140,"ingenious device whereby the workingman permitted the manufacturer to"
"11374",140,"charge him higher prices, in order that he might receive higher wages;"
"11375",140,"thus taking his money out of his pocket with one hand, and putting a"
"11376",140,"part of it back with the other. To the senator this unique arrangement"
"11377",140,"had somehow become identified with the higher verities of the universe."
"11378",140,"It was because of it that Columbia was the gem of the ocean; and all her"
"11379",140,"future triumphs, her power and good repute among the nations, depended"
"11380",140,"upon the zeal and fidelity with which each citizen held up the hands of"
"11381",140,"those who were toiling to maintain it. The name of this heroic company"
"11382",140,"was ""the Grand Old Party""--"
"11383",140,""
"11384",140,"And here the band began to play, and Jurgis sat up with a violent"
"11385",140,"start. Singular as it may seem, Jurgis was making a desperate effort"
"11386",140,"to understand what the senator was saying--to comprehend the extent of"
"11387",140,"American prosperity, the enormous expansion of American commerce, and"
"11388",140,"the Republic's future in the Pacific and in South America, and wherever"
"11389",140,"else the oppressed were groaning. The reason for it was that he wanted"
"11390",140,"to keep awake. He knew that if he allowed himself to fall asleep"
"11391",140,"he would begin to snore loudly; and so he must listen--he must be"
"11392",140,"interested! But he had eaten such a big dinner, and he was so exhausted,"
"11393",140,"and the hall was so warm, and his seat was so comfortable! The senator's"
"11394",140,"gaunt form began to grow dim and hazy, to tower before him and dance"
"11395",140,"about, with figures of exports and imports. Once his neighbor gave him"
"11396",140,"a savage poke in the ribs, and he sat up with a start and tried to look"
"11397",140,"innocent; but then he was at it again, and men began to stare at him"
"11398",140,"with annoyance, and to call out in vexation. Finally one of them called"
"11399",140,"a policeman, who came and grabbed Jurgis by the collar, and jerked him"
"11400",140,"to his feet, bewildered and terrified. Some of the audience turned to"
"11401",140,"see the commotion, and Senator Spareshanks faltered in his speech; but a"
"11402",140,"voice shouted cheerily: ""We're just firing a bum! Go ahead, old sport!"""
"11403",140,"And so the crowd roared, and the senator smiled genially, and went on;"
"11404",140,"and in a few seconds poor Jurgis found himself landed out in the rain,"
"11405",140,"with a kick and a string of curses."
"11406",140,""
"11407",140,"He got into the shelter of a doorway and took stock of himself. He was"
"11408",140,"not hurt, and he was not arrested--more than he had any right to expect."
"11409",140,"He swore at himself and his luck for a while, and then turned his"
"11410",140,"thoughts to practical matters. He had no money, and no place to sleep;"
"11411",140,"he must begin begging again."
"11412",140,""
"11413",140,"He went out, hunching his shoulders together and shivering at the touch"
"11414",140,"of the icy rain. Coming down the street toward him was a lady, well"
"11415",140,"dressed, and protected by an umbrella; and he turned and walked beside"
"11416",140,"her. ""Please, ma'am,"" he began, ""could you lend me the price of a"
"11417",140,"night's lodging? I'm a poor working-man--"""
"11418",140,""
"11419",140,"Then, suddenly, he stopped short. By the light of a street lamp he had"
"11420",140,"caught sight of the lady's face. He knew her."
"11421",140,""
"11422",140,"It was Alena Jasaityte, who had been the belle of his wedding feast!"
"11423",140,"Alena Jasaityte, who had looked so beautiful, and danced with such a"
"11424",140,"queenly air, with Juozas Raczius, the teamster! Jurgis had only seen"
"11425",140,"her once or twice afterward, for Juozas had thrown her over for another"
"11426",140,"girl, and Alena had gone away from Packingtown, no one knew where. And"
"11427",140,"now he met her here!"
"11428",140,""
"11429",140,"She was as much surprised as he was. ""Jurgis Rudkus!"" she gasped. ""And"
"11430",140,"what in the world is the matter with you?"""
"11431",140,""
"11432",140,"""I--I've had hard luck,"" he stammered. ""I'm out of work, and I've no"
"11433",140,"home and no money. And you, Alena--are you married?"""
"11434",140,""
"11435",140,"""No,"" she answered, ""I'm not married, but I've got a good place."""
"11436",140,""
"11437",140,"They stood staring at each other for a few moments longer. Finally Alena"
"11438",140,"spoke again. ""Jurgis,"" she said, ""I'd help you if I could, upon my"
"11439",140,"word I would, but it happens that I've come out without my purse, and"
"11440",140,"I honestly haven't a penny with me: I can do something better for you,"
"11441",140,"though--I can tell you how to get help. I can tell you where Marija is."""
"11442",140,""
"11443",140,"Jurgis gave a start. ""Marija!"" he exclaimed."
"11444",140,""
"11445",140,"""Yes,"" said Alena; ""and she'll help you. She's got a place, and she's"
"11446",140,"doing well; she'll be glad to see you."""
"11447",140,""
"11448",140,"It was not much more than a year since Jurgis had left Packingtown,"
"11449",140,"feeling like one escaped from jail; and it had been from Marija and"
"11450",140,"Elzbieta that he was escaping. But now, at the mere mention of them, his"
"11451",140,"whole being cried out with joy. He wanted to see them; he wanted to go"
"11452",140,"home! They would help him--they would be kind to him. In a flash he had"
"11453",140,"thought over the situation. He had a good excuse for running away--his"
"11454",140,"grief at the death of his son; and also he had a good excuse for not"
"11455",140,"returning--the fact that they had left Packingtown. ""All right,"" he"
"11456",140,"said, ""I'll go."""
"11457",140,""
"11458",140,"So she gave him a number on Clark Street, adding, ""There's no need"
"11459",140,"to give you my address, because Marija knows it."" And Jurgis set out,"
"11460",140,"without further ado. He found a large brownstone house of aristocratic"
"11461",140,"appearance, and rang the basement bell. A young colored girl came to the"
"11462",140,"door, opening it about an inch, and gazing at him suspiciously."
"11463",140,""
"11464",140,"""What do you want?"" she demanded."
"11465",140,""
"11466",140,"""Does Marija Berczynskas live here?"" he inquired."
"11467",140,""
"11468",140,"""I dunno,"" said the girl. ""What you want wid her?"""
"11469",140,""
"11470",140,"""I want to see her,"" said he; ""she's a relative of mine."""
"11471",140,""
"11472",140,"The girl hesitated a moment. Then she opened the door and said, ""Come"

"11474",140,"What's yo' name?"""
"11475",140,""
"11476",140,"""Tell her it's Jurgis,"" he answered, and the girl went upstairs. She"
"11477",140,"came back at the end of a minute or two, and replied, ""Dey ain't no sich"
"11478",140,"person here."""
"11479",140,""
"11480",140,"Jurgis's heart went down into his boots. ""I was told this was where she"
"11481",140,"lived!"" he cried. But the girl only shook her head. ""De lady says dey"
"11482",140,"ain't no sich person here,"" she said."
"11483",140,""
"11484",140,"And he stood for a moment, hesitating, helpless with dismay. Then he"
"11485",140,"turned to go to the door. At the same instant, however, there came a"
"11486",140,"knock upon it, and the girl went to open it. Jurgis heard the shuffling"
"11487",140,"of feet, and then heard her give a cry; and the next moment she sprang"
"11488",140,"back, and past him, her eyes shining white with terror, and bounded up"
"11489",140,"the stairway, screaming at the top of her lungs: ""Police! Police! We're"
"11490",140,"pinched!"""
"11491",140,""
"11492",140,"Jurgis stood for a second, bewildered. Then, seeing blue-coated forms"
"11493",140,"rushing upon him, he sprang after the Negress. Her cries had been the"
"11494",140,"signal for a wild uproar above; the house was full of people, and as he"
"11495",140,"entered the hallway he saw them rushing hither and thither, crying and"
"11496",140,"screaming with alarm. There were men and women, the latter clad for the"
"11497",140,"most part in wrappers, the former in all stages of dishabille. At one"
"11498",140,"side Jurgis caught a glimpse of a big apartment with plush-covered"
"11499",140,"chairs, and tables covered with trays and glasses. There were playing"
"11500",140,"cards scattered all over the floor--one of the tables had been upset,"
"11501",140,"and bottles of wine were rolling about, their contents running out upon"
"11502",140,"the carpet. There was a young girl who had fainted, and two men who were"
"11503",140,"supporting her; and there were a dozen others crowding toward the front"
"11504",140,"door."
"11505",140,""
"11506",140,"Suddenly, however, there came a series of resounding blows upon it,"
"11507",140,"causing the crowd to give back. At the same instant a stout woman, with"
"11508",140,"painted cheeks and diamonds in her ears, came running down the stairs,"
"11509",140,"panting breathlessly: ""To the rear! Quick!"""
"11510",140,""
"11511",140,"She led the way to a back staircase, Jurgis following; in the kitchen"
"11512",140,"she pressed a spring, and a cupboard gave way and opened, disclosing a"
"11513",140,"dark passageway. ""Go in!"" she cried to the crowd, which now amounted to"
"11514",140,"twenty or thirty, and they began to pass through. Scarcely had the last"
"11515",140,"one disappeared, however, before there were cries from in front, and"
"11516",140,"then the panic-stricken throng poured out again, exclaiming: ""They're"
"11517",140,"there too! We're trapped!"""
"11518",140,""
"11519",140,"""Upstairs!"" cried the woman, and there was another rush of the mob,"
"11520",140,"women and men cursing and screaming and fighting to be first. One"
"11521",140,"flight, two, three--and then there was a ladder to the roof, with a"
"11522",140,"crowd packed at the foot of it, and one man at the top, straining and"
"11523",140,"struggling to lift the trap door. It was not to be stirred, however,"
"11524",140,"and when the woman shouted up to unhook it, he answered: ""It's already"
"11525",140,"unhooked. There's somebody sitting on it!"""
"11526",140,""
"11527",140,"And a moment later came a voice from downstairs: ""You might as well"
"11528",140,"quit, you people. We mean business, this time."""
"11529",140,""
"11530",140,"So the crowd subsided; and a few moments later several policemen came"
"11531",140,"up, staring here and there, and leering at their victims. Of the latter"
"11532",140,"the men were for the most part frightened and sheepish-looking. The"
"11533",140,"women took it as a joke, as if they were used to it--though if they had"
"11534",140,"been pale, one could not have told, for the paint on their cheeks. One"
"11535",140,"black-eyed young girl perched herself upon the top of the balustrade,"
"11536",140,"and began to kick with her slippered foot at the helmets of the"
"11537",140,"policemen, until one of them caught her by the ankle and pulled her"
"11538",140,"down. On the floor below four or five other girls sat upon trunks in the"
"11539",140,"hall, making fun of the procession which filed by them. They were noisy"
"11540",140,"and hilarious, and had evidently been drinking; one of them, who wore a"
"11541",140,"bright red kimono, shouted and screamed in a voice that drowned out all"
"11542",140,"the other sounds in the hall--and Jurgis took a glance at her, and then"
"11543",140,"gave a start, and a cry, ""Marija!"""
"11544",140,""
"11545",140,"She heard him, and glanced around; then she shrank back and half sprang"
"11546",140,"to her feet in amazement. ""Jurgis!"" she gasped."
"11547",140,""
"11548",140,"For a second or two they stood staring at each other. ""How did you come"
"11549",140,"here?"" Marija exclaimed."
"11550",140,""

"11561",140,"Again there was a silence, while they gazed at each other. The rest of"

"11563",140,"him. ""And you?"" Jurgis asked. ""You live here?"""
"11564",140,""
"11565",140,"""Yes,"" said Marija, ""I live here."" Then suddenly came a hail from below:"

"11572",140,"""Come,"" said Marija, and took Jurgis into her room, which was a tiny"
"11573",140,"place about eight by six, with a cot and a chair and a dressing stand"
"11574",140,"and some dresses hanging behind the door. There were clothes scattered"
"11575",140,"about on the floor, and hopeless confusion everywhere--boxes of rouge"
"11576",140,"and bottles of perfume mixed with hats and soiled dishes on the dresser,"

"11733",140,"grandfathers; some of them wore evening dress--there was no one among"

"11736",140,"When the roundup was completed, the doors were opened and the party"
"11737",140,"marched out. Three patrol wagons were drawn up at the curb, and the"
"11738",140,"whole neighborhood had turned out to see the sport; there was much"
"11739",140,"chaffing, and a universal craning of necks. The women stared about them"
"11740",140,"with defiant eyes, or laughed and joked, while the men kept their heads"
"11741",140,"bowed, and their hats pulled over their faces. They were crowded into"
"11742",140,"the patrol wagons as if into streetcars, and then off they went amid a"
"11743",140,"din of cheers. At the station house Jurgis gave a Polish name and was"
"11744",140,"put into a cell with half a dozen others; and while these sat and"
"11745",140,"talked in whispers, he lay down in a corner and gave himself up to his"

"11747",140,""
"11748",140,"Jurgis had looked into the deepest reaches of the social pit, and grown"

"11750",140,"vile and hideous, he had somehow always excepted his own family that he"
"11751",140,"had loved; and now this sudden horrible discovery--Marija a whore, and"
"11752",140,"Elzbieta and the children living off her shame! Jurgis might argue"
"11753",140,"with himself all he chose, that he had done worse, and was a fool"
"11754",140,"for caring--but still he could not get over the shock of that sudden"
"11755",140,"unveiling, he could not help being sunk in grief because of it. The"
"11756",140,"depths of him were troubled and shaken, memories were stirred in him"
"11757",140,"that had been sleeping so long he had counted them dead. Memories of the"
"11758",140,"old life--his old hopes and his old yearnings, his old dreams of decency"
"11759",140,"and independence! He saw Ona again, he heard her gentle voice pleading"
"11760",140,"with him. He saw little Antanas, whom he had meant to make a man. He saw"
"11761",140,"his trembling old father, who had blessed them all with his wonderful"
"11762",140,"love. He lived again through that day of horror when he had discovered"
"11763",140,"Ona's shame--God, how he had suffered, what a madman he had been!"
"11764",140,"How dreadful it had all seemed to him; and now, today, he had sat and"
"11765",140,"listened, and half agreed when Marija told him he had been a fool!"
"11766",140,"Yes--told him that he ought to have sold his wife's honor and lived by"
"11767",140,"it!--And then there was Stanislovas and his awful fate--that brief story"
"11768",140,"which Marija had narrated so calmly, with such dull indifference! The"
"11769",140,"poor little fellow, with his frostbitten fingers and his terror of the"
"11770",140,"snow--his wailing voice rang in Jurgis's ears, as he lay there in the"
"11771",140,"darkness, until the sweat started on his forehead. Now and then he"
"11772",140,"would quiver with a sudden spasm of horror, at the picture of little"
"11773",140,"Stanislovas shut up in the deserted building and fighting for his life"
"11774",140,"with the rats!"
"11775",140,""
"11776",140,"All these emotions had become strangers to the soul of Jurgis; it was so"
"11777",140,"long since they had troubled him that he had ceased to think they might"
"11778",140,"ever trouble him again. Helpless, trapped, as he was, what good did they"
"11779",140,"do him--why should he ever have allowed them to torment him? It had been"
"11780",140,"the task of his recent life to fight them down, to crush them out of"
"11781",140,"him; never in his life would he have suffered from them again, save"
"11782",140,"that they had caught him unawares, and overwhelmed him before he could"
"11783",140,"protect himself. He heard the old voices of his soul, he saw its old"
"11784",140,"ghosts beckoning to him, stretching out their arms to him! But they were"
"11785",140,"far-off and shadowy, and the gulf between them was black and bottomless;"
"11786",140,"they would fade away into the mists of the past once more. Their voices"
"11787",140,"would die, and never again would he hear them--and so the last faint"
"11788",140,"spark of manhood in his soul would flicker out."

"11797",140,"were called up first, and reprimanded in a bunch, and then dismissed;"
"11798",140,"but, Jurgis, to his terror, was called separately, as being a"
"11799",140,"suspicious-looking case. It was in this very same court that he had been"
"11800",140,"tried, that time when his sentence had been ""suspended""; it was the same"

"11808",140,"in a better place; then he let him go, and proceeded to fine each of the"

"11955",140,""
"11956",140,"""How do you need money?"" was her reply. ""All you want is something to"
"11957",140,"eat and a place to sleep, isn't it?"""
"11958",140,""
"11959",140,"""Yes,"" he said; ""but then I don't like to go there after I left"
"11960",140,"them--and while I have nothing to do, and while you--you--"""
"11961",140,""
"11962",140,"""Go on!"" said Marija, giving him a push. ""What are you talking?--I won't"
"11963",140,"give you money,"" she added, as she followed him to the door, ""because"
"11964",140,"you'll drink it up, and do yourself harm. Here's a quarter for you now,"
"11965",140,"and go along, and they'll be so glad to have you back, you won't have"
"11966",140,"time to feel ashamed. Good-by!"""
"11967",140,""
"11968",140,""
"11969",140,"So Jurgis went out, and walked down the street to think it over. He"
"11970",140,"decided that he would first try to get work, and so he put in the rest"
"11971",140,"of the day wandering here and there among factories and warehouses"
"11972",140,"without success. Then, when it was nearly dark, he concluded to go home,"
"11973",140,"and set out; but he came to a restaurant, and went in and spent his"
"11974",140,"quarter for a meal; and when he came out he changed his mind--the night"
"11975",140,"was pleasant, and he would sleep somewhere outside, and put in the"
"11976",140,"morrow hunting, and so have one more chance of a job. So he started away"
"11977",140,"again, when suddenly he chanced to look about him, and found that he"
"11978",140,"was walking down the same street and past the same hall where he had"
"11979",140,"listened to the political speech the night before. There was no red"
"11980",140,"fire and no band now, but there was a sign out, announcing a meeting,"
"11981",140,"and a stream of people pouring in through the entrance. In a flash"
"11982",140,"Jurgis had decided that he would chance it once more, and sit down"
"11983",140,"and rest while making up his mind what to do. There was no one taking"
"11984",140,"tickets, so it must be a free show again."
"11985",140,""
"11986",140,"He entered. There were no decorations in the hall this time; but there"
"11987",140,"was quite a crowd upon the platform, and almost every seat in the place"
"11988",140,"was filled. He took one of the last, far in the rear, and straightway"
"11989",140,"forgot all about his surroundings. Would Elzbieta think that he had come"
"11990",140,"to sponge off her, or would she understand that he meant to get to work"
"11991",140,"again and do his share? Would she be decent to him, or would she scold"
"11992",140,"him? If only he could get some sort of a job before he went--if that"
"11993",140,"last boss had only been willing to try him!"
"11994",140,""
"11995",140,"--Then suddenly Jurgis looked up. A tremendous roar had burst from the"
"11996",140,"throats of the crowd, which by this time had packed the hall to the very"
"11997",140,"doors. Men and women were standing up, waving handkerchiefs, shouting,"
"11998",140,"yelling. Evidently the speaker had arrived, thought Jurgis; what fools"
"11999",140,"they were making of themselves! What were they expecting to get out"
"12000",140,"of it anyhow--what had they to do with elections, with governing the"
"12001",140,"country? Jurgis had been behind the scenes in politics."
"12002",140,""
"12003",140,"He went back to his thoughts, but with one further fact to reckon"
"12004",140,"with--that he was caught here. The hall was now filled to the doors; and"
"12005",140,"after the meeting it would be too late for him to go home, so he would"
"12006",140,"have to make the best of it outside. Perhaps it would be better to go"
"12007",140,"home in the morning, anyway, for the children would be at school, and"
"12008",140,"he and Elzbieta could have a quiet explanation. She always had been a"
"12009",140,"reasonable person; and he really did mean to do right. He would manage"
"12010",140,"to persuade her of it--and besides, Marija was willing, and Marija was"
"12011",140,"furnishing the money. If Elzbieta were ugly, he would tell her that in"
"12012",140,"so many words."
"12013",140,""
"12014",140,"So Jurgis went on meditating; until finally, when he had been an hour"
"12015",140,"or two in the hall, there began to prepare itself a repetition of the"
"12016",140,"dismal catastrophe of the night before. Speaking had been going on"
"12017",140,"all the time, and the audience was clapping its hands and shouting,"
"12018",140,"thrilling with excitement; and little by little the sounds were"
"12019",140,"beginning to blur in Jurgis's ears, and his thoughts were beginning to"
"12020",140,"run together, and his head to wobble and nod. He caught himself many"
"12021",140,"times, as usual, and made desperate resolutions; but the hall was hot"
"12022",140,"and close, and his long walk and is dinner were too much for him--in the"
"12023",140,"end his head sank forward and he went off again."
"12024",140,""
"12025",140,"And then again someone nudged him, and he sat up with his old terrified"
"12026",140,"start! He had been snoring again, of course! And now what? He fixed his"
"12027",140,"eyes ahead of him, with painful intensity, staring at the platform as"
"12028",140,"if nothing else ever had interested him, or ever could interest him, all"
"12029",140,"his life. He imagined the angry exclamations, the hostile glances; he"
"12030",140,"imagined the policeman striding toward him--reaching for his neck. Or"
"12031",140,"was he to have one more chance? Were they going to let him alone this"
"12032",140,"time? He sat trembling; waiting--"
"12033",140,""
"12034",140,"And then suddenly came a voice in his ear, a woman's voice, gentle"
"12035",140,"and sweet, ""If you would try to listen, comrade, perhaps you would be"
"12036",140,"interested."""
"12037",140,""
"12038",140,"Jurgis was more startled by that than he would have been by the touch of"
"12039",140,"a policeman. He still kept his eyes fixed ahead, and did not stir;"
"12040",140,"but his heart gave a great leap. Comrade! Who was it that called him"
"12041",140,"""comrade""?"
"12042",140,""
"12043",140,"He waited long, long; and at last, when he was sure that he was no"
"12044",140,"longer watched, he stole a glance out of the corner of his eyes at the"
"12045",140,"woman who sat beside him. She was young and beautiful; she wore fine"
"12046",140,"clothes, and was what is called a ""lady."" And she called him ""comrade""!"
"12047",140,""
"12048",140,"He turned a little, carefully, so that he could see her better; then he"
"12049",140,"began to watch her, fascinated. She had apparently forgotten all"
"12050",140,"about him, and was looking toward the platform. A man was speaking"
"12051",140,"there--Jurgis heard his voice vaguely; but all his thoughts were for"
"12052",140,"this woman's face. A feeling of alarm stole over him as he stared at"
"12053",140,"her. It made his flesh creep. What was the matter with her, what could"
"12054",140,"be going on, to affect any one like that? She sat as one turned to"
"12055",140,"stone, her hands clenched tightly in her lap, so tightly that he could"
"12056",140,"see the cords standing out in her wrists. There was a look of excitement"
"12057",140,"upon her face, of tense effort, as of one struggling mightily, or"
"12058",140,"witnessing a struggle. There was a faint quivering of her nostrils; and"
"12059",140,"now and then she would moisten her lips with feverish haste. Her bosom"
"12060",140,"rose and fell as she breathed, and her excitement seemed to mount higher"
"12061",140,"and higher, and then to sink away again, like a boat tossing upon ocean"
"12062",140,"surges. What was it? What was the matter? It must be something that the"
"12063",140,"man was saying, up there on the platform. What sort of a man was he?"
"12064",140,"And what sort of thing was this, anyhow?--So all at once it occurred to"
"12065",140,"Jurgis to look at the speaker."
"12066",140,""
"12067",140,"It was like coming suddenly upon some wild sight of nature--a mountain"
"12068",140,"forest lashed by a tempest, a ship tossed about upon a stormy sea."
"12069",140,"Jurgis had an unpleasant sensation, a sense of confusion, of disorder,"
"12070",140,"of wild and meaningless uproar. The man was tall and gaunt, as haggard"
"12071",140,"as his auditor himself; a thin black beard covered half of his face,"
"12072",140,"and one could see only two black hollows where the eyes were. He was"
"12073",140,"speaking rapidly, in great excitement; he used many gestures--as he spoke"
"12074",140,"he moved here and there upon the stage, reaching with his long arms as"
"12075",140,"if to seize each person in his audience. His voice was deep, like an"
"12076",140,"organ; it was some time, however, before Jurgis thought of the voice--he"
"12077",140,"was too much occupied with his eyes to think of what the man was saying."
"12078",140,"But suddenly it seemed as if the speaker had begun pointing straight at"
"12079",140,"him, as if he had singled him out particularly for his remarks; and"
"12080",140,"so Jurgis became suddenly aware of his voice, trembling, vibrant with"
"12081",140,"emotion, with pain and longing, with a burden of things unutterable, not"
"12082",140,"to be compassed by words. To hear it was to be suddenly arrested, to be"
"12083",140,"gripped, transfixed."
"12084",140,""
"12085",140,"""You listen to these things,"" the man was saying, ""and you say, 'Yes,"
"12086",140,"they are true, but they have been that way always.' Or you say, 'Maybe"
"12087",140,"it will come, but not in my time--it will not help me.' And so you"
"12088",140,"return to your daily round of toil, you go back to be ground up for"
"12089",140,"profits in the world-wide mill of economic might! To toil long hours"
"12090",140,"for another's advantage; to live in mean and squalid homes, to work in"
"12091",140,"dangerous and unhealthful places; to wrestle with the specters of hunger"
"12092",140,"and privation, to take your chances of accident, disease, and death. And"
"12093",140,"each day the struggle becomes fiercer, the pace more cruel; each day"
"12094",140,"you have to toil a little harder, and feel the iron hand of circumstance"
"12095",140,"close upon you a little tighter. Months pass, years maybe--and then you"
"12096",140,"come again; and again I am here to plead with you, to know if want and"
"12097",140,"misery have yet done their work with you, if injustice and oppression"
"12098",140,"have yet opened your eyes! I shall still be waiting--there is nothing"
"12099",140,"else that I can do. There is no wilderness where I can hide from these"
"12100",140,"things, there is no haven where I can escape them; though I travel to"
"12101",140,"the ends of the earth, I find the same accursed system--I find that all"
"12102",140,"the fair and noble impulses of humanity, the dreams of poets and the"
"12103",140,"agonies of martyrs, are shackled and bound in the service of organized"
"12104",140,"and predatory Greed! And therefore I cannot rest, I cannot be"
"12105",140,"silent; therefore I cast aside comfort and happiness, health and good"
"12106",140,"repute--and go out into the world and cry out the pain of my spirit!"
"12107",140,"Therefore I am not to be silenced by poverty and sickness, not by hatred"
"12108",140,"and obloquy, by threats and ridicule--not by prison and persecution, if"
"12109",140,"they should come--not by any power that is upon the earth or above the"
"12110",140,"earth, that was, or is, or ever can be created. If I fail tonight, I can"
"12111",140,"only try tomorrow; knowing that the fault must be mine--that if once"
"12112",140,"the vision of my soul were spoken upon earth, if once the anguish of"
"12113",140,"its defeat were uttered in human speech, it would break the stoutest"
"12114",140,"barriers of prejudice, it would shake the most sluggish soul to action!"
"12115",140,"It would abash the most cynical, it would terrify the most selfish; and"
"12116",140,"the voice of mockery would be silenced, and fraud and falsehood would"
"12117",140,"slink back into their dens, and the truth would stand forth alone! For I"
"12118",140,"speak with the voice of the millions who are voiceless! Of them that are"
"12119",140,"oppressed and have no comforter! Of the disinherited of life, for whom"
"12120",140,"there is no respite and no deliverance, to whom the world is a prison, a"
"12121",140,"dungeon of torture, a tomb! With the voice of the little child who toils"
"12122",140,"tonight in a Southern cotton mill, staggering with exhaustion, numb"
"12123",140,"with agony, and knowing no hope but the grave! Of the mother who sews by"
"12124",140,"candlelight in her tenement garret, weary and weeping, smitten with"
"12125",140,"the mortal hunger of her babes! Of the man who lies upon a bed of rags,"
"12126",140,"wrestling in his last sickness and leaving his loved ones to perish! Of"
"12127",140,"the young girl who, somewhere at this moment, is walking the streets of"
"12128",140,"this horrible city, beaten and starving, and making her choice between"
"12129",140,"the brothel and the lake! With the voice of those, whoever and wherever"
"12130",140,"they may be, who are caught beneath the wheels of the Juggernaut of"
"12131",140,"Greed! With the voice of humanity, calling for deliverance! Of the"
"12132",140,"everlasting soul of Man, arising from the dust; breaking its way out of"
"12133",140,"its prison--rending the bands of oppression and ignorance--groping its"
"12134",140,"way to the light!"""
"12135",140,""
"12136",140,"The speaker paused. There was an instant of silence, while men caught"
"12137",140,"their breaths, and then like a single sound there came a cry from a"
"12138",140,"thousand people. Through it all Jurgis sat still, motionless and rigid,"
"12139",140,"his eyes fixed upon the speaker; he was trembling, smitten with wonder."
"12140",140,""
"12141",140,"Suddenly the man raised his hands, and silence fell, and he began again."
"12142",140,""
"12143",140,"""I plead with you,"" he said, ""whoever you may be, provided that you care"
"12144",140,"about the truth; but most of all I plead with working-man, with those"
"12145",140,"to whom the evils I portray are not mere matters of sentiment, to be"
"12146",140,"dallied and toyed with, and then perhaps put aside and forgotten--to"
"12147",140,"whom they are the grim and relentless realities of the daily grind, the"
"12148",140,"chains upon their limbs, the lash upon their backs, the iron in their"
"12149",140,"souls. To you, working-men! To you, the toilers, who have made this"
"12150",140,"land, and have no voice in its councils! To you, whose lot it is to sow"
"12151",140,"that others may reap, to labor and obey, and ask no more than the wages"
"12152",140,"of a beast of burden, the food and shelter to keep you alive from day to"
"12153",140,"day. It is to you that I come with my message of salvation, it is to you"
"12154",140,"that I appeal. I know how much it is to ask of you--I know, for I have"
"12155",140,"been in your place, I have lived your life, and there is no man before"
"12156",140,"me here tonight who knows it better. I have known what it is to be a"
"12157",140,"street-waif, a bootblack, living upon a crust of bread and sleeping in"
"12158",140,"cellar stairways and under empty wagons. I have known what it is to dare"
"12159",140,"and to aspire, to dream mighty dreams and to see them perish--to see all"
"12160",140,"the fair flowers of my spirit trampled into the mire by the wild-beast"
"12161",140,"powers of my life. I know what is the price that a working-man pays for"
"12162",140,"knowledge--I have paid for it with food and sleep, with agony of body"
"12163",140,"and mind, with health, almost with life itself; and so, when I come to"
"12164",140,"you with a story of hope and freedom, with the vision of a new earth to"
"12165",140,"be created, of a new labor to be dared, I am not surprised that I find"
"12166",140,"you sordid and material, sluggish and incredulous. That I do not despair"
"12167",140,"is because I know also the forces that are driving behind you--because"
"12168",140,"I know the raging lash of poverty, the sting of contempt and mastership,"
"12169",140,"'the insolence of office and the spurns.' Because I feel sure that in"
"12170",140,"the crowd that has come to me tonight, no matter how many may be dull"
"12171",140,"and heedless, no matter how many may have come out of idle curiosity, or"
"12172",140,"in order to ridicule--there will be some one man whom pain and suffering"
"12173",140,"have made desperate, whom some chance vision of wrong and horror has"
"12174",140,"startled and shocked into attention. And to him my words will come like"
"12175",140,"a sudden flash of lightning to one who travels in darkness--revealing"
"12176",140,"the way before him, the perils and the obstacles--solving all problems,"
"12177",140,"making all difficulties clear! The scales will fall from his eyes, the"
"12178",140,"shackles will be torn from his limbs--he will leap up with a cry of"
"12179",140,"thankfulness, he will stride forth a free man at last! A man"
"12180",140,"delivered from his self-created slavery! A man who will never more"
"12181",140,"be trapped--whom no blandishments will cajole, whom no threats will"
"12182",140,"frighten; who from tonight on will move forward, and not backward, who"
"12183",140,"will study and understand, who will gird on his sword and take his"
"12184",140,"place in the army of his comrades and brothers. Who will carry the good"
"12185",140,"tidings to others, as I have carried them to him--priceless gift of"
"12186",140,"liberty and light that is neither mine nor his, but is the heritage of"
"12187",140,"the soul of man! Working-men, working-men--comrades! open your eyes and"
"12188",140,"look about you! You have lived so long in the toil and heat that your"
"12189",140,"senses are dulled, your souls are numbed; but realize once in your lives"
"12190",140,"this world in which you dwell--tear off the rags of its customs and"
"12191",140,"conventions--behold it as it is, in all its hideous nakedness! Realize"
"12192",140,"it, realize it! Realize that out upon the plains of Manchuria tonight"
"12193",140,"two hostile armies are facing each other--that now, while we are seated"
"12194",140,"here, a million human beings may be hurled at each other's throats,"
"12195",140,"striving with the fury of maniacs to tear each other to pieces! And this"
"12196",140,"in the twentieth century, nineteen hundred years since the Prince of"
"12197",140,"Peace was born on earth! Nineteen hundred years that his words have been"
"12198",140,"preached as divine, and here two armies of men are rending and tearing"
"12199",140,"each other like the wild beasts of the forest! Philosophers have"
"12200",140,"reasoned, prophets have denounced, poets have wept and pleaded--and"
"12201",140,"still this hideous Monster roams at large! We have schools and colleges,"
"12202",140,"newspapers and books; we have searched the heavens and the earth, we"
"12203",140,"have weighed and probed and reasoned--and all to equip men to destroy"
"12204",140,"each other! We call it War, and pass it by--but do not put me off with"
"12205",140,"platitudes and conventions--come with me, come with me--realize it!"
"12206",140,"See the bodies of men pierced by bullets, blown into pieces by bursting"
"12207",140,"shells! Hear the crunching of the bayonet, plunged into human flesh;"
"12208",140,"hear the groans and shrieks of agony, see the faces of men crazed by"
"12209",140,"pain, turned into fiends by fury and hate! Put your hand upon that piece"
"12210",140,"of flesh--it is hot and quivering--just now it was a part of a man! This"
"12211",140,"blood is still steaming--it was driven by a human heart! Almighty God!"
"12212",140,"and this goes on--it is systematic, organized, premeditated! And we know"
"12213",140,"it, and read of it, and take it for granted; our papers tell of it, and"
"12214",140,"the presses are not stopped--our churches know of it, and do not close"
"12215",140,"their doors--the people behold it, and do not rise up in horror and"
"12216",140,"revolution!"
"12217",140,""
"12218",140,"""Or perhaps Manchuria is too far away for you--come home with me then,"
"12219",140,"come here to Chicago. Here in this city to-night ten thousand women are"
"12220",140,"shut up in foul pens, and driven by hunger to sell their bodies to live."
"12221",140,"And we know it, we make it a jest! And these women are made in the image"
"12222",140,"of your mothers, they may be your sisters, your daughters; the child"
"12223",140,"whom you left at home tonight, whose laughing eyes will greet you in the"
"12224",140,"morning--that fate may be waiting for her! To-night in Chicago there are"
"12225",140,"ten thousand men, homeless and wretched, willing to work and begging for"
"12226",140,"a chance, yet starving, and fronting in terror the awful winter cold!"
"12227",140,"Tonight in Chicago there are a hundred thousand children wearing out"
"12228",140,"their strength and blasting their lives in the effort to earn their"
"12229",140,"bread! There are a hundred thousand mothers who are living in misery and"
"12230",140,"squalor, struggling to earn enough to feed their little ones! There are"
"12231",140,"a hundred thousand old people, cast off and helpless, waiting for death"
"12232",140,"to take them from their torments! There are a million people, men and"
"12233",140,"women and children, who share the curse of the wage-slave; who toil"
"12234",140,"every hour they can stand and see, for just enough to keep them alive;"
"12235",140,"who are condemned till the end of their days to monotony and weariness,"
"12236",140,"to hunger and misery, to heat and cold, to dirt and disease, to"
"12237",140,"ignorance and drunkenness and vice! And then turn over the page with me,"
"12238",140,"and gaze upon the other side of the picture. There are a thousand--ten"
"12239",140,"thousand, maybe--who are the masters of these slaves, who own their"
"12240",140,"toil. They do nothing to earn what they receive, they do not even have"
"12241",140,"to ask for it--it comes to them of itself, their only care is to dispose"
"12242",140,"of it. They live in palaces, they riot in luxury and extravagance--such"
"12243",140,"as no words can describe, as makes the imagination reel and stagger,"
"12244",140,"makes the soul grow sick and faint. They spend hundreds of dollars for a"
"12245",140,"pair of shoes, a handkerchief, a garter; they spend millions for horses"
"12246",140,"and automobiles and yachts, for palaces and banquets, for little shiny"
"12247",140,"stones with which to deck their bodies. Their life is a contest among"
"12248",140,"themselves for supremacy in ostentation and recklessness, in the"
"12249",140,"destroying of useful and necessary things, in the wasting of the labor"
"12250",140,"and the lives of their fellow creatures, the toil and anguish of the"
"12251",140,"nations, the sweat and tears and blood of the human race! It is all"
"12252",140,"theirs--it comes to them; just as all the springs pour into streamlets,"
"12253",140,"and the streamlets into rivers, and the rivers into the oceans--so,"
"12254",140,"automatically and inevitably, all the wealth of society comes to them."
"12255",140,"The farmer tills the soil, the miner digs in the earth, the weaver tends"
"12256",140,"the loom, the mason carves the stone; the clever man invents, the shrewd"
"12257",140,"man directs, the wise man studies, the inspired man sings--and all the"
"12258",140,"result, the products of the labor of brain and muscle, are gathered into"
"12259",140,"one stupendous stream and poured into their laps! The whole of society"
"12260",140,"is in their grip, the whole labor of the world lies at their mercy--and"
"12261",140,"like fierce wolves they rend and destroy, like ravening vultures they"
"12262",140,"devour and tear! The whole power of mankind belongs to them, forever"
"12263",140,"and beyond recall--do what it can, strive as it will, humanity lives for"
"12264",140,"them and dies for them! They own not merely the labor of society, they"
"12265",140,"have bought the governments; and everywhere they use their raped and"
"12266",140,"stolen power to intrench themselves in their privileges, to dig wider"
"12267",140,"and deeper the channels through which the river of profits flows to"
"12268",140,"them!--And you, workingmen, workingmen! You have been brought up to"
"12269",140,"it, you plod on like beasts of burden, thinking only of the day and its"
"12270",140,"pain--yet is there a man among you who can believe that such a system"
"12271",140,"will continue forever--is there a man here in this audience tonight"
"12272",140,"so hardened and debased that he dare rise up before me and say that"
"12273",140,"he believes it can continue forever; that the product of the labor of"
"12274",140,"society, the means of existence of the human race, will always belong"
"12275",140,"to idlers and parasites, to be spent for the gratification of vanity and"
"12276",140,"lust--to be spent for any purpose whatever, to be at the disposal of any"
"12277",140,"individual will whatever--that somehow, somewhere, the labor of humanity"
"12278",140,"will not belong to humanity, to be used for the purposes of humanity, to"
"12279",140,"be controlled by the will of humanity? And if this is ever to be, how is"
"12280",140,"it to be--what power is there that will bring it about? Will it be the"
"12281",140,"task of your masters, do you think--will they write the charter of your"
"12282",140,"liberties? Will they forge you the sword of your deliverance, will they"
"12283",140,"marshal you the army and lead it to the fray? Will their wealth be spent"
"12284",140,"for the purpose--will they build colleges and churches to teach you,"
"12285",140,"will they print papers to herald your progress, and organize political"
"12286",140,"parties to guide and carry on the struggle? Can you not see that the"
"12287",140,"task is your task--yours to dream, yours to resolve, yours to execute?"
"12288",140,"That if ever it is carried out, it will be in the face of every obstacle"
"12289",140,"that wealth and mastership can oppose--in the face of ridicule and"
"12290",140,"slander, of hatred and persecution, of the bludgeon and the jail? That"
"12291",140,"it will be by the power of your naked bosoms, opposed to the rage of"
"12292",140,"oppression! By the grim and bitter teaching of blind and merciless"
"12293",140,"affliction! By the painful gropings of the untutored mind, by the feeble"
"12294",140,"stammerings of the uncultured voice! By the sad and lonely hunger of"
"12295",140,"the spirit; by seeking and striving and yearning, by heartache and"
"12296",140,"despairing, by agony and sweat of blood! It will be by money paid for"
"12297",140,"with hunger, by knowledge stolen from sleep, by thoughts communicated"
"12298",140,"under the shadow of the gallows! It will be a movement beginning in the"
"12299",140,"far-off past, a thing obscure and unhonored, a thing easy to ridicule,"
"12300",140,"easy to despise; a thing unlovely, wearing the aspect of vengeance and"
"12301",140,"hate--but to you, the working-man, the wage-slave, calling with a voice"
"12302",140,"insistent, imperious--with a voice that you cannot escape, wherever upon"
"12303",140,"the earth you may be! With the voice of all your wrongs, with the voice"
"12304",140,"of all your desires; with the voice of your duty and your hope--of"
"12305",140,"everything in the world that is worth while to you! The voice of the"
"12306",140,"poor, demanding that poverty shall cease! The voice of the oppressed,"
"12307",140,"pronouncing the doom of oppression! The voice of power, wrought out of"
"12308",140,"suffering--of resolution, crushed out of weakness--of joy and courage,"
"12309",140,"born in the bottomless pit of anguish and despair! The voice of Labor,"
"12310",140,"despised and outraged; a mighty giant, lying prostrate--mountainous,"
"12311",140,"colossal, but blinded, bound, and ignorant of his strength. And now a"
"12312",140,"dream of resistance haunts him, hope battling with fear; until suddenly"
"12313",140,"he stirs, and a fetter snaps--and a thrill shoots through him, to the"
"12314",140,"farthest ends of his huge body, and in a flash the dream becomes an act!"
"12315",140,"He starts, he lifts himself; and the bands are shattered, the burdens"
"12316",140,"roll off him--he rises--towering, gigantic; he springs to his feet, he"
"12317",140,"shouts in his newborn exultation--"""
"12318",140,""
"12319",140,"And the speaker's voice broke suddenly, with the stress of his feelings;"
"12320",140,"he stood with his arms stretched out above him, and the power of his"
"12321",140,"vision seemed to lift him from the floor. The audience came to its feet"
"12322",140,"with a yell; men waved their arms, laughing aloud in their excitement."
"12323",140,"And Jurgis was with them, he was shouting to tear his throat; shouting"
"12324",140,"because he could not help it, because the stress of his feeling was more"
"12325",140,"than he could bear. It was not merely the man's words, the torrent"
"12326",140,"of his eloquence. It was his presence, it was his voice: a voice with"
"12327",140,"strange intonations that rang through the chambers of the soul like the"
"12328",140,"clanging of a bell--that gripped the listener like a mighty hand about"
"12329",140,"his body, that shook him and startled him with sudden fright, with"
"12330",140,"a sense of things not of earth, of mysteries never spoken before, of"
"12331",140,"presences of awe and terror! There was an unfolding of vistas before"
"12332",140,"him, a breaking of the ground beneath him, an upheaving, a stirring,"
"12333",140,"a trembling; he felt himself suddenly a mere man no longer--there were"
"12334",140,"powers within him undreamed of, there were demon forces contending,"
"12335",140,"age-long wonders struggling to be born; and he sat oppressed with pain"
"12336",140,"and joy, while a tingling stole down into his finger tips, and his"
"12337",140,"breath came hard and fast. The sentences of this man were to Jurgis like"
"12338",140,"the crashing of thunder in his soul; a flood of emotions surged up"
"12339",140,"in him--all his old hopes and longings, his old griefs and rages and"
"12340",140,"despairs. All that he had ever felt in his whole life seemed to come"
"12341",140,"back to him at once, and with one new emotion, hardly to be described."
"12342",140,"That he should have suffered such oppressions and such horrors was bad"
"12343",140,"enough; but that he should have been crushed and beaten by them, that he"
"12344",140,"should have submitted, and forgotten, and lived in peace--ah, truly that"
"12345",140,"was a thing not to be put into words, a thing not to be borne by a human"
"12346",140,"creature, a thing of terror and madness! ""What,"" asks the prophet, ""is"
"12347",140,"the murder of them that kill the body, to the murder of them that kill"
"12348",140,"the soul?"" And Jurgis was a man whose soul had been murdered, who had"
"12349",140,"ceased to hope and to struggle--who had made terms with degradation"
"12350",140,"and despair; and now, suddenly, in one awful convulsion, the black and"
"12351",140,"hideous fact was made plain to him! There was a falling in of all the"
"12352",140,"pillars of his soul, the sky seemed to split above him--he stood there,"
"12353",140,"with his clenched hands upraised, his eyes bloodshot, and the veins"
"12354",140,"standing out purple in his face, roaring in the voice of a wild beast,"
"12355",140,"frantic, incoherent, maniacal. And when he could shout no more he still"
"12356",140,"stood there, gasping, and whispering hoarsely to himself: ""By God! By"
"12357",140,"God! By God!"""

"12362",140,""
"12363",140,"The man had gone back to a seat upon the platform, and Jurgis realized"
"12364",140,"that his speech was over. The applause continued for several minutes;"
"12365",140,"and then some one started a song, and the crowd took it up, and the"
"12366",140,"place shook with it. Jurgis had never heard it, and he could not make"
"12367",140,"out the words, but the wild and wonderful spirit of it seized upon"
"12368",140,"him--it was the ""Marseillaise!"" As stanza after stanza of it thundered"
"12369",140,"forth, he sat with his hands clasped, trembling in every nerve. He"
"12370",140,"had never been so stirred in his life--it was a miracle that had been"
"12371",140,"wrought in him. He could not think at all, he was stunned; yet he knew"
"12372",140,"that in the mighty upheaval that had taken place in his soul, a new man"
"12373",140,"had been born. He had been torn out of the jaws of destruction, he had"
"12374",140,"been delivered from the thraldom of despair; the whole world had been"
"12375",140,"changed for him--he was free, he was free! Even if he were to suffer as"
"12376",140,"he had before, even if he were to beg and starve, nothing would be the"
"12377",140,"same to him; he would understand it, and bear it. He would no longer"
"12378",140,"be the sport of circumstances, he would be a man, with a will and a"
"12379",140,"purpose; he would have something to fight for, something to die for,"
"12380",140,"if need be! Here were men who would show him and help him; and he would"
"12381",140,"have friends and allies, he would dwell in the sight of justice, and"
"12382",140,"walk arm in arm with power."
"12383",140,""
"12384",140,"The audience subsided again, and Jurgis sat back. The chairman of the"
"12385",140,"meeting came forward and began to speak. His voice sounded thin and"
"12386",140,"futile after the other's, and to Jurgis it seemed a profanation. Why"
"12387",140,"should any one else speak, after that miraculous man--why should they"
"12388",140,"not all sit in silence? The chairman was explaining that a collection"
"12389",140,"would now be taken up to defray the expenses of the meeting, and for the"
"12390",140,"benefit of the campaign fund of the party. Jurgis heard; but he had not"
"12391",140,"a penny to give, and so his thoughts went elsewhere again."
"12392",140,""
"12393",140,"He kept his eyes fixed on the orator, who sat in an armchair, his head"
"12394",140,"leaning on his hand and his attitude indicating exhaustion. But suddenly"
"12395",140,"he stood up again, and Jurgis heard the chairman of the meeting saying"
"12396",140,"that the speaker would now answer any questions which the audience might"
"12397",140,"care to put to him. The man came forward, and some one--a woman--arose"
"12398",140,"and asked about some opinion the speaker had expressed concerning"
"12399",140,"Tolstoy. Jurgis had never heard of Tolstoy, and did not care anything"
"12400",140,"about him. Why should any one want to ask such questions, after an"
"12401",140,"address like that? The thing was not to talk, but to do; the thing was"
"12402",140,"to get bold of others and rouse them, to organize them and prepare for"
"12403",140,"the fight! But still the discussion went on, in ordinary conversational"
"12404",140,"tones, and it brought Jurgis back to the everyday world. A few minutes"
"12405",140,"ago he had felt like seizing the hand of the beautiful lady by his side,"
"12406",140,"and kissing it; he had felt like flinging his arms about the neck of the"
"12407",140,"man on the other side of him. And now he began to realize again that he"
"12408",140,"was a ""hobo,"" that he was ragged and dirty, and smelled bad, and had no"
"12409",140,"place to sleep that night!"
"12410",140,""
"12411",140,"And so, at last, when the meeting broke up, and the audience started to"
"12412",140,"leave, poor Jurgis was in an agony of uncertainty. He had not thought of"
"12413",140,"leaving--he had thought that the vision must last forever, that he had"
"12414",140,"found comrades and brothers. But now he would go out, and the thing"
"12415",140,"would fade away, and he would never be able to find it again! He sat in"
"12416",140,"his seat, frightened and wondering; but others in the same row wanted to"
"12417",140,"get out, and so he had to stand up and move along. As he was swept down"
"12418",140,"the aisle he looked from one person to another, wistfully; they were all"
"12419",140,"excitedly discussing the address--but there was nobody who offered to"
"12420",140,"discuss it with him. He was near enough to the door to feel the night"
"12421",140,"air, when desperation seized him. He knew nothing at all about that"
"12422",140,"speech he had heard, not even the name of the orator; and he was to go"
"12423",140,"away--no, no, it was preposterous, he must speak to some one; he must"
"12424",140,"find that man himself and tell him. He would not despise him, tramp as"
"12425",140,"he was!"
"12426",140,""
"12427",140,"So he stepped into an empty row of seats and watched, and when the crowd"
"12428",140,"had thinned out, he started toward the platform. The speaker was gone;"
"12429",140,"but there was a stage door that stood open, with people passing in and"
"12430",140,"out, and no one on guard. Jurgis summoned up his courage and went in,"
"12431",140,"and down a hallway, and to the door of a room where many people were"
"12432",140,"crowded. No one paid any attention to him, and he pushed in, and in a"
"12433",140,"corner he saw the man he sought. The orator sat in a chair, with his"
"12434",140,"shoulders sunk together and his eyes half closed; his face was ghastly"
"12435",140,"pale, almost greenish in hue, and one arm lay limp at his side. A big"
"12436",140,"man with spectacles on stood near him, and kept pushing back the crowd,"
"12437",140,"saying, ""Stand away a little, please; can't you see the comrade is worn"
"12438",140,"out?"""
"12439",140,""
"12440",140,"So Jurgis stood watching, while five or ten minutes passed. Now and then"
"12441",140,"the man would look up, and address a word or two to those who were"
"12442",140,"near him; and, at last, on one of these occasions, his glance rested"
"12443",140,"on Jurgis. There seemed to be a slight hint of inquiry about it, and a"
"12444",140,"sudden impulse seized the other. He stepped forward."
"12445",140,""
"12446",140,"""I wanted to thank you, sir!"" he began, in breathless haste. ""I could"
"12447",140,"not go away without telling you how much--how glad I am I heard you."
"12448",140,"I--I didn't know anything about it all--"""
"12449",140,""
"12450",140,"The big man with the spectacles, who had moved away, came back at this"
"12451",140,"moment. ""The comrade is too tired to talk to any one--"" he began; but"
"12452",140,"the other held up his hand."
"12453",140,""
"12454",140,"""Wait,"" he said. ""He has something to say to me."" And then he looked"
"12455",140,"into Jurgis's face. ""You want to know more about Socialism?"" he asked."
"12456",140,""
"12457",140,"Jurgis started. ""I--I--"" he stammered. ""Is it Socialism? I didn't know."
"12458",140,"I want to know about what you spoke of--I want to help. I have been"
"12459",140,"through all that."""

"12466",140,""
"12467",140,"""Lithuanian, sir."""
"12468",140,""
"12469",140,"The man thought for a moment, and then turned to his friend. ""Who is"
"12470",140,"there, Walters?"" he asked. ""There is Ostrinski--but he is a Pole--"""
"12471",140,""
"12472",140,"""Ostrinski speaks Lithuanian,"" said the other. ""All right, then; would"
"12473",140,"you mind seeing if he has gone yet?"""
"12474",140,""
"12475",140,"The other started away, and the speaker looked at Jurgis again. He had"
"12476",140,"deep, black eyes, and a face full of gentleness and pain. ""You must"
"12477",140,"excuse me, comrade,"" he said. ""I am just tired out--I have spoken every"
"12478",140,"day for the last month. I will introduce you to some one who will be"
"12479",140,"able to help you as well as I could--"""
"12480",140,""
"12481",140,"The messenger had had to go no further than the door, he came back,"
"12482",140,"followed by a man whom he introduced to Jurgis as ""Comrade Ostrinski."""
"12483",140,"Comrade Ostrinski was a little man, scarcely up to Jurgis's shoulder,"
"12484",140,"wizened and wrinkled, very ugly, and slightly lame. He had on a"
"12485",140,"long-tailed black coat, worn green at the seams and the buttonholes; his"
"12486",140,"eyes must have been weak, for he wore green spectacles that gave him"
"12487",140,"a grotesque appearance. But his handclasp was hearty, and he spoke in"
"12488",140,"Lithuanian, which warmed Jurgis to him."
"12489",140,""
"12490",140,"""You want to know about Socialism?"" he said. ""Surely. Let us go out and"
"12491",140,"take a stroll, where we can be quiet and talk some."""
"12492",140,""
"12493",140,"And so Jurgis bade farewell to the master wizard, and went out."
"12494",140,"Ostrinski asked where he lived, offering to walk in that direction;"
"12495",140,"and so he had to explain once more that he was without a home. At the"
"12496",140,"other's request he told his story; how he had come to America, and"
"12497",140,"what had happened to him in the stockyards, and how his family had been"
"12498",140,"broken up, and how he had become a wanderer. So much the little man"
"12499",140,"heard, and then he pressed Jurgis's arm tightly. ""You have been through"
"12500",140,"the mill, comrade!"" he said. ""We will make a fighter out of you!"""
"12501",140,""
"12502",140,"Then Ostrinski in turn explained his circumstances. He would have asked"
"12503",140,"Jurgis to his home--but he had only two rooms, and had no bed to offer."
"12504",140,"He would have given up his own bed, but his wife was ill. Later on, when"
"12505",140,"he understood that otherwise Jurgis would have to sleep in a hallway,"
"12506",140,"he offered him his kitchen floor, a chance which the other was only too"
"12507",140,"glad to accept. ""Perhaps tomorrow we can do better,"" said Ostrinski. ""We"
"12508",140,"try not to let a comrade starve."""
"12509",140,""
"12510",140,"Ostrinski's home was in the Ghetto district, where he had two rooms in"
"12511",140,"the basement of a tenement. There was a baby crying as they entered,"
"12512",140,"and he closed the door leading into the bedroom. He had three young"
"12513",140,"children, he explained, and a baby had just come. He drew up two chairs"
"12514",140,"near the kitchen stove, adding that Jurgis must excuse the disorder of"
"12515",140,"the place, since at such a time one's domestic arrangements were upset."
"12516",140,"Half of the kitchen was given up to a workbench, which was piled with"
"12517",140,"clothing, and Ostrinski explained that he was a ""pants finisher."" He"
"12518",140,"brought great bundles of clothing here to his home, where he and his"
"12519",140,"wife worked on them. He made a living at it, but it was getting harder"
"12520",140,"all the time, because his eyes were failing. What would come when they"
"12521",140,"gave out he could not tell; there had been no saving anything--a man"
"12522",140,"could barely keep alive by twelve or fourteen hours' work a day. The"
"12523",140,"finishing of pants did not take much skill, and anybody could learn it,"
"12524",140,"and so the pay was forever getting less. That was the competitive wage"
"12525",140,"system; and if Jurgis wanted to understand what Socialism was, it was"
"12526",140,"there he had best begin. The workers were dependent upon a job to exist"
"12527",140,"from day to day, and so they bid against each other, and no man could"
"12528",140,"get more than the lowest man would consent to work for. And thus"
"12529",140,"the mass of the people were always in a life-and-death struggle with"
"12530",140,"poverty. That was ""competition,"" so far as it concerned the wage-earner,"
"12531",140,"the man who had only his labor to sell; to those on top, the exploiters,"
"12532",140,"it appeared very differently, of course--there were few of them, and"
"12533",140,"they could combine and dominate, and their power would be unbreakable."
"12534",140,"And so all over the world two classes were forming, with an unbridged"
"12535",140,"chasm between them--the capitalist class, with its enormous fortunes,"
"12536",140,"and the proletariat, bound into slavery by unseen chains. The latter"
"12537",140,"were a thousand to one in numbers, but they were ignorant and helpless,"
"12538",140,"and they would remain at the mercy of their exploiters until they were"
"12539",140,"organized--until they had become ""class-conscious."" It was a slow"
"12540",140,"and weary process, but it would go on--it was like the movement of a"
"12541",140,"glacier, once it was started it could never be stopped. Every"
"12542",140,"Socialist did his share, and lived upon the vision of the ""good time"
"12543",140,"coming,""--when the working class should go to the polls and seize the"
"12544",140,"powers of government, and put an end to private property in the means"
"12545",140,"of production. No matter how poor a man was, or how much he suffered, he"
"12546",140,"could never be really unhappy while he knew of that future; even if he"
"12547",140,"did not live to see it himself, his children would, and, to a Socialist,"
"12548",140,"the victory of his class was his victory. Also he had always the"
"12549",140,"progress to encourage him; here in Chicago, for instance, the movement"
"12550",140,"was growing by leaps and bounds. Chicago was the industrial center"
"12551",140,"of the country, and nowhere else were the unions so strong; but their"
"12552",140,"organizations did the workers little good, for the employers were"
"12553",140,"organized, also; and so the strikes generally failed, and as fast as the"
"12554",140,"unions were broken up the men were coming over to the Socialists."
"12555",140,""
"12556",140,"Ostrinski explained the organization of the party, the machinery by"
"12557",140,"which the proletariat was educating itself. There were ""locals"" in every"
"12558",140,"big city and town, and they were being organized rapidly in the smaller"
"12559",140,"places; a local had anywhere from six to a thousand members, and there"
"12560",140,"were fourteen hundred of them in all, with a total of about twenty-five"
"12561",140,"thousand members, who paid dues to support the organization. ""Local Cook"
"12562",140,"County,"" as the city organization was called, had eighty branch locals,"
"12563",140,"and it alone was spending several thousand dollars in the campaign. It"
"12564",140,"published a weekly in English, and one each in Bohemian and German; also"
"12565",140,"there was a monthly published in Chicago, and a cooperative publishing"
"12566",140,"house, that issued a million and a half of Socialist books and pamphlets"
"12567",140,"every year. All this was the growth of the last few years--there had"
"12568",140,"been almost nothing of it when Ostrinski first came to Chicago."
"12569",140,""
"12570",140,"Ostrinski was a Pole, about fifty years of age. He had lived in Silesia,"
"12571",140,"a member of a despised and persecuted race, and had taken part in the"
"12572",140,"proletarian movement in the early seventies, when Bismarck, having"
"12573",140,"conquered France, had turned his policy of blood and iron upon the"
"12574",140,"""International."" Ostrinski himself had twice been in jail, but he had"
"12575",140,"been young then, and had not cared. He had had more of his share of the"
"12576",140,"fight, though, for just when Socialism had broken all its barriers and"
"12577",140,"become the great political force of the empire, he had come to America,"
"12578",140,"and begun all over again. In America every one had laughed at the mere"
"12579",140,"idea of Socialism then--in America all men were free. As if political"
"12580",140,"liberty made wage slavery any the more tolerable! said Ostrinski."
"12581",140,""
"12582",140,"The little tailor sat tilted back in his stiff kitchen chair, with his"
"12583",140,"feet stretched out upon the empty stove, and speaking in low whispers,"
"12584",140,"so as not to waken those in the next room. To Jurgis he seemed a"
"12585",140,"scarcely less wonderful person than the speaker at the meeting; he was"
"12586",140,"poor, the lowest of the low, hunger-driven and miserable--and yet how"
"12587",140,"much he knew, how much he had dared and achieved, what a hero he had"
"12588",140,"been! There were others like him, too--thousands like him, and all of"
"12589",140,"them workingmen! That all this wonderful machinery of progress had been"
"12590",140,"created by his fellows--Jurgis could not believe it, it seemed too good"
"12591",140,"to be true."
"12592",140,""
"12593",140,"That was always the way, said Ostrinski; when a man was first converted"
"12594",140,"to Socialism he was like a crazy person--he could not understand how"
"12595",140,"others could fail to see it, and he expected to convert all the world"
"12596",140,"the first week. After a while he would realize how hard a task it was;"
"12597",140,"and then it would be fortunate that other new hands kept coming, to save"
"12598",140,"him from settling down into a rut. Just now Jurgis would have plenty of"
"12599",140,"chance to vent his excitement, for a presidential campaign was on, and"
"12600",140,"everybody was talking politics. Ostrinski would take him to the next"
"12601",140,"meeting of the branch local, and introduce him, and he might join the"
"12602",140,"party. The dues were five cents a week, but any one who could not afford"
"12603",140,"this might be excused from paying. The Socialist party was a really"
"12604",140,"democratic political organization--it was controlled absolutely by"
"12605",140,"its own membership, and had no bosses. All of these things Ostrinski"
"12606",140,"explained, as also the principles of the party. You might say that there"
"12607",140,"was really but one Socialist principle--that of ""no compromise,"" which"
"12608",140,"was the essence of the proletarian movement all over the world. When a"
"12609",140,"Socialist was elected to office he voted with old party legislators for"
"12610",140,"any measure that was likely to be of help to the working class, but"
"12611",140,"he never forgot that these concessions, whatever they might be, were"
"12612",140,"trifles compared with the great purpose--the organizing of the working"
"12613",140,"class for the revolution. So far, the rule in America had been that"
"12614",140,"one Socialist made another Socialist once every two years; and if"
"12615",140,"they should maintain the same rate they would carry the country in"
"12616",140,"1912--though not all of them expected to succeed as quickly as that."
"12617",140,""
"12618",140,"The Socialists were organized in every civilized nation; it was an"
"12619",140,"international political party, said Ostrinski, the greatest the world"
"12620",140,"had ever known. It numbered thirty million of adherents, and it cast"
"12621",140,"eight million votes. It had started its first newspaper in Japan, and"
"12622",140,"elected its first deputy in Argentina; in France it named members of"
"12623",140,"cabinets, and in Italy and Australia it held the balance of power and"
"12624",140,"turned out ministries. In Germany, where its vote was more than a third"
"12625",140,"of the total vote of the empire, all other parties and powers had united"
"12626",140,"to fight it. It would not do, Ostrinski explained, for the proletariat"
"12627",140,"of one nation to achieve the victory, for that nation would be crushed"
"12628",140,"by the military power of the others; and so the Socialist movement was a"
"12629",140,"world movement, an organization of all mankind to establish liberty and"
"12630",140,"fraternity. It was the new religion of humanity--or you might say it was"
"12631",140,"the fulfillment of the old religion, since it implied but the literal"
"12632",140,"application of all the teachings of Christ."
"12633",140,""
"12634",140,""
"12635",140,"Until long after midnight Jurgis sat lost in the conversation of his"
"12636",140,"new acquaintance. It was a most wonderful experience to him--an almost"
"12637",140,"supernatural experience. It was like encountering an inhabitant of"
"12638",140,"the fourth dimension of space, a being who was free from all one's"
"12639",140,"own limitations. For four years, now, Jurgis had been wondering and"
"12640",140,"blundering in the depths of a wilderness; and here, suddenly, a hand"
"12641",140,"reached down and seized him, and lifted him out of it, and set him upon"
"12642",140,"a mountain-top, from which he could survey it all--could see the paths"
"12643",140,"from which he had wandered, the morasses into which he had stumbled, the"
"12644",140,"hiding places of the beasts of prey that had fallen upon him. There"
"12645",140,"were his Packingtown experiences, for instance--what was there about"
"12646",140,"Packingtown that Ostrinski could not explain! To Jurgis the packers had"
"12647",140,"been equivalent to fate; Ostrinski showed him that they were the Beef"
"12648",140,"Trust. They were a gigantic combination of capital, which had crushed"
"12649",140,"all opposition, and overthrown the laws of the land, and was preying"
"12650",140,"upon the people. Jurgis recollected how, when he had first come to"
"12651",140,"Packingtown, he had stood and watched the hog-killing, and thought how"
"12652",140,"cruel and savage it was, and come away congratulating himself that he"
"12653",140,"was not a hog; now his new acquaintance showed him that a hog was just"
"12654",140,"what he had been--one of the packers' hogs. What they wanted from a hog"
"12655",140,"was all the profits that could be got out of him; and that was what they"
"12656",140,"wanted from the workingman, and also that was what they wanted from"
"12657",140,"the public. What the hog thought of it, and what he suffered, were"
"12658",140,"not considered; and no more was it with labor, and no more with the"
"12659",140,"purchaser of meat. That was true everywhere in the world, but it was"
"12660",140,"especially true in Packingtown; there seemed to be something about the"
"12661",140,"work of slaughtering that tended to ruthlessness and ferocity--it was"
"12662",140,"literally the fact that in the methods of the packers a hundred human"
"12663",140,"lives did not balance a penny of profit. When Jurgis had made himself"
"12664",140,"familiar with the Socialist literature, as he would very quickly, he"
"12665",140,"would get glimpses of the Beef Trust from all sorts of aspects, and he"
"12666",140,"would find it everywhere the same; it was the incarnation of blind and"
"12667",140,"insensate Greed. It was a monster devouring with a thousand mouths,"
"12668",140,"trampling with a thousand hoofs; it was the Great Butcher--it was the"
"12669",140,"spirit of Capitalism made flesh. Upon the ocean of commerce it sailed"
"12670",140,"as a pirate ship; it had hoisted the black flag and declared war upon"
"12671",140,"civilization. Bribery and corruption were its everyday methods. In"
"12672",140,"Chicago the city government was simply one of its branch offices; it"
"12673",140,"stole billions of gallons of city water openly, it dictated to the"
"12674",140,"courts the sentences of disorderly strikers, it forbade the mayor to"
"12675",140,"enforce the building laws against it. In the national capital it had"
"12676",140,"power to prevent inspection of its product, and to falsify government"
"12677",140,"reports; it violated the rebate laws, and when an investigation was"
"12678",140,"threatened it burned its books and sent its criminal agents out of the"
"12679",140,"country. In the commercial world it was a Juggernaut car; it wiped out"
"12680",140,"thousands of businesses every year, it drove men to madness and suicide."
"12681",140,"It had forced the price of cattle so low as to destroy the stock-raising"
"12682",140,"industry, an occupation upon which whole states existed; it had ruined"
"12683",140,"thousands of butchers who had refused to handle its products. It divided"
"12684",140,"the country into districts, and fixed the price of meat in all of them;"
"12685",140,"and it owned all the refrigerator cars, and levied an enormous tribute"
"12686",140,"upon all poultry and eggs and fruit and vegetables. With the millions"
"12687",140,"of dollars a week that poured in upon it, it was reaching out for"
"12688",140,"the control of other interests, railroads and trolley lines, gas and"
"12689",140,"electric light franchises--it already owned the leather and the grain"
"12690",140,"business of the country. The people were tremendously stirred up over"
"12691",140,"its encroachments, but nobody had any remedy to suggest; it was the task"
"12692",140,"of Socialists to teach and organize them, and prepare them for the time"
"12693",140,"when they were to seize the huge machine called the Beef Trust, and use"
"12694",140,"it to produce food for human beings and not to heap up fortunes for a"
"12695",140,"band of pirates. It was long after midnight when Jurgis lay down upon"
"12696",140,"the floor of Ostrinski's kitchen; and yet it was an hour before he"
"12697",140,"could get to sleep, for the glory of that joyful vision of the people of"
"12698",140,"Packingtown marching in and taking possession of the Union Stockyards!"

"12704",140,"Jurgis had breakfast with Ostrinski and his family, and then he went"
"12705",140,"home to Elzbieta. He was no longer shy about it--when he went in,"
"12706",140,"instead of saying all the things he had been planning to say, he started"
"12707",140,"to tell Elzbieta about the revolution! At first she thought he was out"
"12708",140,"of his mind, and it was hours before she could really feel certain that"
"12709",140,"he was himself. When, however, she had satisfied herself that he was"
"12710",140,"sane upon all subjects except politics, she troubled herself no"
"12711",140,"further about it. Jurgis was destined to find that Elzbieta's armor was"
"12712",140,"absolutely impervious to Socialism. Her soul had been baked hard in the"
"12713",140,"fire of adversity, and there was no altering it now; life to her was the"
"12714",140,"hunt for daily bread, and ideas existed for her only as they bore upon"
"12715",140,"that. All that interested her in regard to this new frenzy which had"
"12716",140,"seized hold of her son-in-law was whether or not it had a tendency to"
"12717",140,"make him sober and industrious; and when she found he intended to look"
"12718",140,"for work and to contribute his share to the family fund, she gave him"
"12719",140,"full rein to convince her of anything. A wonderfully wise little woman"
"12720",140,"was Elzbieta; she could think as quickly as a hunted rabbit, and in half"
"12721",140,"an hour she had chosen her life-attitude to the Socialist movement."
"12722",140,"She agreed in everything with Jurgis, except the need of his paying his"
"12723",140,"dues; and she would even go to a meeting with him now and then, and sit"
"12724",140,"and plan her next day's dinner amid the storm."
"12725",140,""
"12726",140,"For a week after he became a convert Jurgis continued to wander about"
"12727",140,"all day, looking for work; until at last he met with a strange fortune."
"12728",140,"He was passing one of Chicago's innumerable small hotels, and after some"
"12729",140,"hesitation he concluded to go in. A man he took for the proprietor was"
"12730",140,"standing in the lobby, and he went up to him and tackled him for a job."
"12731",140,""
"12732",140,"""What can you do?"" the man asked."
"12733",140,""
"12734",140,"""Anything, sir,"" said Jurgis, and added quickly: ""I've been out of work"
"12735",140,"for a long time, sir. I'm an honest man, and I'm strong and willing--"""
"12736",140,""
"12737",140,"The other was eying him narrowly. ""Do you drink?"" he asked."
"12738",140,""
"12739",140,"""No, sir,"" said Jurgis."
"12740",140,""
"12741",140,"""Well, I've been employing a man as a porter, and he drinks. I've"
"12742",140,"discharged him seven times now, and I've about made up my mind that's"

"12754",140,""
"12755",140,"And so Jurgis fell to work, and toiled like a Trojan till night. Then"
"12756",140,"he went and told Elzbieta, and also, late as it was, he paid a visit to"
"12757",140,"Ostrinski to let him know of his good fortune. Here he received a great"
"12758",140,"surprise, for when he was describing the location of the hotel Ostrinski"
"12759",140,"interrupted suddenly, ""Not Hinds's!"""
"12760",140,""

"12770",140,"Socialist!"""
"12771",140,""
"12772",140,"So, after that, Jurgis was known to his ""boss"" as ""Comrade Jurgis,"" and"

"12777",140,"liveliest--inexhaustible in his enthusiasm, and talking Socialism all"
"12778",140,"day and all night. He was a great fellow to jolly along a crowd, and"
"12779",140,"would keep a meeting in an uproar; when once he got really waked up, the"
"12780",140,"torrent of his eloquence could be compared with nothing save Niagara."
"12781",140,""
"12782",140,"Tommy Hinds had begun life as a blacksmith's helper, and had run away"
"12783",140,"to join the Union army, where he had made his first acquaintance with"
"12784",140,"""graft,"" in the shape of rotten muskets and shoddy blankets. To a"
"12785",140,"musket that broke in a crisis he always attributed the death of his only"
"12786",140,"brother, and upon worthless blankets he blamed all the agonies of his"
"12787",140,"own old age. Whenever it rained, the rheumatism would get into his"
"12788",140,"joints, and then he would screw up his face and mutter: ""Capitalism, my"
"12789",140,"boy, capitalism! 'Ecrasez l'infame!'"" He had one unfailing remedy for"
"12790",140,"all the evils of this world, and he preached it to every one; no matter"
"12791",140,"whether the person's trouble was failure in business, or dyspepsia, or"
"12792",140,"a quarrelsome mother-in-law, a twinkle would come into his eyes and he"
"12793",140,"would say, ""You know what to do about it--vote the Socialist ticket!"""
"12794",140,""
"12795",140,"Tommy Hinds had set out upon the trail of the Octopus as soon as the war"
"12796",140,"was over. He had gone into business, and found himself in competition"
"12797",140,"with the fortunes of those who had been stealing while he had been"
"12798",140,"fighting. The city government was in their hands and the railroads were"
"12799",140,"in league with them, and honest business was driven to the wall; and"
"12800",140,"so Hinds had put all his savings into Chicago real estate, and set out"
"12801",140,"singlehanded to dam the river of graft. He had been a reform member"
"12802",140,"of the city council, he had been a Greenbacker, a Labor Unionist, a"
"12803",140,"Populist, a Bryanite--and after thirty years of fighting, the year 1896"
"12804",140,"had served to convince him that the power of concentrated wealth could"
"12805",140,"never be controlled, but could only be destroyed. He had published a"
"12806",140,"pamphlet about it, and set out to organize a party of his own, when a"
"12807",140,"stray Socialist leaflet had revealed to him that others had been"
"12808",140,"ahead of him. Now for eight years he had been fighting for the"
"12809",140,"party, anywhere, everywhere--whether it was a G.A.R. reunion, or a"
"12810",140,"hotel-keepers' convention, or an Afro-American business-men's banquet, or"
"12811",140,"a Bible society picnic, Tommy Hinds would manage to get himself invited"
"12812",140,"to explain the relations of Socialism to the subject in hand. After that"
"12813",140,"he would start off upon a tour of his own, ending at some place between"
"12814",140,"New York and Oregon; and when he came back from there, he would go out"
"12815",140,"to organize new locals for the state committee; and finally he would"
"12816",140,"come home to rest--and talk Socialism in Chicago. Hinds's hotel was a"
"12817",140,"very hot-bed of the propaganda; all the employees were party men, and if"
"12818",140,"they were not when they came, they were quite certain to be before they"
"12819",140,"went away. The proprietor would get into a discussion with some one in"
"12820",140,"the lobby, and as the conversation grew animated, others would gather"
"12821",140,"about to listen, until finally every one in the place would be crowded"
"12822",140,"into a group, and a regular debate would be under way. This went on"
"12823",140,"every night--when Tommy Hinds was not there to do it, his clerk did it;"
"12824",140,"and when his clerk was away campaigning, the assistant attended to it,"
"12825",140,"while Mrs. Hinds sat behind the desk and did the work. The clerk was an"
"12826",140,"old crony of the proprietor's, an awkward, rawboned giant of a man, with"
"12827",140,"a lean, sallow face, a broad mouth, and whiskers under his chin,"
"12828",140,"the very type and body of a prairie farmer. He had been that all his"
"12829",140,"life--he had fought the railroads in Kansas for fifty years, a Granger,"
"12830",140,"a Farmers' Alliance man, a ""middle-of-the-road"" Populist. Finally, Tommy"
"12831",140,"Hinds had revealed to him the wonderful idea of using the trusts instead"
"12832",140,"of destroying them, and he had sold his farm and come to Chicago."
"12833",140,""
"12834",140,"That was Amos Struver; and then there was Harry Adams, the assistant"
"12835",140,"clerk, a pale, scholarly-looking man, who came from Massachusetts, of"
"12836",140,"Pilgrim stock. Adams had been a cotton operative in Fall River, and the"
"12837",140,"continued depression in the industry had worn him and his family out,"
"12838",140,"and he had emigrated to South Carolina. In Massachusetts the percentage"
"12839",140,"of white illiteracy is eight-tenths of one per cent, while in South"
"12840",140,"Carolina it is thirteen and six-tenths per cent; also in South Carolina"
"12841",140,"there is a property qualification for voters--and for these and other"
"12842",140,"reasons child labor is the rule, and so the cotton mills were driving"
"12843",140,"those of Massachusetts out of the business. Adams did not know this, he"
"12844",140,"only knew that the Southern mills were running; but when he got there"
"12845",140,"he found that if he was to live, all his family would have to work, and"
"12846",140,"from six o'clock at night to six o'clock in the morning. So he had set"
"12847",140,"to work to organize the mill hands, after the fashion in Massachusetts,"
"12848",140,"and had been discharged; but he had gotten other work, and stuck at it,"
"12849",140,"and at last there had been a strike for shorter hours, and Harry Adams"
"12850",140,"had attempted to address a street meeting, which was the end of him."
"12851",140,"In the states of the far South the labor of convicts is leased to"
"12852",140,"contractors, and when there are not convicts enough they have to be"
"12853",140,"supplied. Harry Adams was sent up by a judge who was a cousin of the"
"12854",140,"mill owner with whose business he had interfered; and though the life"
"12855",140,"had nearly killed him, he had been wise enough not to murmur, and at"
"12856",140,"the end of his term he and his family had left the state of South"
"12857",140,"Carolina--hell's back yard, as he called it. He had no money for"
"12858",140,"carfare, but it was harvest-time, and they walked one day and worked"
"12859",140,"the next; and so Adams got at last to Chicago, and joined the Socialist"
"12860",140,"party. He was a studious man, reserved, and nothing of an orator; but"
"12861",140,"he always had a pile of books under his desk in the hotel, and articles"
"12862",140,"from his pen were beginning to attract attention in the party press."
"12863",140,""
"12864",140,"Contrary to what one would have expected, all this radicalism did not"
"12865",140,"hurt the hotel business; the radicals flocked to it, and the commercial"
"12866",140,"travelers all found it diverting. Of late, also, the hotel had become a"
"12867",140,"favorite stopping place for Western cattlemen. Now that the Beef Trust"
"12868",140,"had adopted the trick of raising prices to induce enormous shipments of"
"12869",140,"cattle, and then dropping them again and scooping in all they needed,"
"12870",140,"a stock raiser was very apt to find himself in Chicago without money"
"12871",140,"enough to pay his freight bill; and so he had to go to a cheap hotel,"
"12872",140,"and it was no drawback to him if there was an agitator talking in the"
"12873",140,"lobby. These Western fellows were just ""meat"" for Tommy Hinds--he"
"12874",140,"would get a dozen of them around him and paint little pictures of ""the"
"12875",140,"System."" Of course, it was not a week before he had heard Jurgis's"
"12876",140,"story, and after that he would not have let his new porter go for the"
"12877",140,"world. ""See here,"" he would say, in the middle of an argument, ""I've got"
"12878",140,"a fellow right here in my place who's worked there and seen every bit of"
"12879",140,"it!"" And then Jurgis would drop his work, whatever it was, and come, and"
"12880",140,"the other would say, ""Comrade Jurgis, just tell these gentlemen what you"
"12881",140,"saw on the killing-beds."" At first this request caused poor Jurgis the"
"12882",140,"most acute agony, and it was like pulling teeth to get him to talk; but"
"12883",140,"gradually he found out what was wanted, and in the end he learned to"
"12884",140,"stand up and speak his piece with enthusiasm. His employer would sit by"
"12885",140,"and encourage him with exclamations and shakes of the head; when Jurgis"
"12886",140,"would give the formula for ""potted ham,"" or tell about the condemned"
"12887",140,"hogs that were dropped into the ""destructors"" at the top and immediately"
"12888",140,"taken out again at the bottom, to be shipped into another state and made"
"12889",140,"into lard, Tommy Hinds would bang his knee and cry, ""Do you think a man"
"12890",140,"could make up a thing like that out of his head?"""
"12891",140,""
"12892",140,"And then the hotel-keeper would go on to show how the Socialists had the"
"12893",140,"only real remedy for such evils, how they alone ""meant business"" with"
"12894",140,"the Beef Trust. And when, in answer to this, the victim would say that"
"12895",140,"the whole country was getting stirred up, that the newspapers were full"
"12896",140,"of denunciations of it, and the government taking action against it,"
"12897",140,"Tommy Hinds had a knock-out blow all ready. ""Yes,"" he would say, ""all"
"12898",140,"that is true--but what do you suppose is the reason for it? Are you"
"12899",140,"foolish enough to believe that it's done for the public? There are"
"12900",140,"other trusts in the country just as illegal and extortionate as the Beef"
"12901",140,"Trust: there is the Coal Trust, that freezes the poor in winter--there"
"12902",140,"is the Steel Trust, that doubles the price of every nail in your"
"12903",140,"shoes--there is the Oil Trust, that keeps you from reading at night--and"
"12904",140,"why do you suppose it is that all the fury of the press and the"
"12905",140,"government is directed against the Beef Trust?"" And when to this the"
"12906",140,"victim would reply that there was clamor enough over the Oil Trust, the"
"12907",140,"other would continue: ""Ten years ago Henry D. Lloyd told all the truth"
"12908",140,"about the Standard Oil Company in his Wealth versus Commonwealth; and"
"12909",140,"the book was allowed to die, and you hardly ever hear of it. And now, at"
"12910",140,"last, two magazines have the courage to tackle 'Standard Oil' again, and"
"12911",140,"what happens? The newspapers ridicule the authors, the churches defend"
"12912",140,"the criminals, and the government--does nothing. And now, why is it all"
"12913",140,"so different with the Beef Trust?"""
"12914",140,""
"12915",140,"Here the other would generally admit that he was ""stuck""; and Tommy"
"12916",140,"Hinds would explain to him, and it was fun to see his eyes open. ""If you"
"12917",140,"were a Socialist,"" the hotel-keeper would say, ""you would understand that"
"12918",140,"the power which really governs the United States today is the Railroad"
"12919",140,"Trust. It is the Railroad Trust that runs your state government,"
"12920",140,"wherever you live, and that runs the United States Senate. And all of"
"12921",140,"the trusts that I have named are railroad trusts--save only the Beef"
"12922",140,"Trust! The Beef Trust has defied the railroads--it is plundering them"
"12923",140,"day by day through the Private Car; and so the public is roused to"
"12924",140,"fury, and the papers clamor for action, and the government goes on the"
"12925",140,"war-path! And you poor common people watch and applaud the job, and"
"12926",140,"think it's all done for you, and never dream that it is really the grand"
"12927",140,"climax of the century-long battle of commercial competition--the final"
"12928",140,"death grapple between the chiefs of the Beef Trust and 'Standard Oil,'"
"12929",140,"for the prize of the mastery and ownership of the United States of"
"12930",140,"America!"""
"12931",140,""
"12932",140,""
"12933",140,"Such was the new home in which Jurgis lived and worked, and in which his"
"12934",140,"education was completed. Perhaps you would imagine that he did not do"
"12935",140,"much work there, but that would be a great mistake. He would have cut"
"12936",140,"off one hand for Tommy Hinds; and to keep Hinds's hotel a thing of"
"12937",140,"beauty was his joy in life. That he had a score of Socialist arguments"
"12938",140,"chasing through his brain in the meantime did not interfere with"
"12939",140,"this; on the contrary, Jurgis scrubbed the spittoons and polished"
"12940",140,"the banisters all the more vehemently because at the same time he was"
"12941",140,"wrestling inwardly with an imaginary recalcitrant. It would be pleasant"
"12942",140,"to record that he swore off drinking immediately, and all the rest"
"12943",140,"of his bad habits with it; but that would hardly be exact. These"
"12944",140,"revolutionists were not angels; they were men, and men who had come up"
"12945",140,"from the social pit, and with the mire of it smeared over them. Some of"
"12946",140,"them drank, and some of them swore, and some of them ate pie with their"
"12947",140,"knives; there was only one difference between them and all the rest of"
"12948",140,"the populace--that they were men with a hope, with a cause to fight"
"12949",140,"for and suffer for. There came times to Jurgis when the vision seemed"
"12950",140,"far-off and pale, and a glass of beer loomed large in comparison; but"
"12951",140,"if the glass led to another glass, and to too many glasses, he had"
"12952",140,"something to spur him to remorse and resolution on the morrow. It was"
"12953",140,"so evidently a wicked thing to spend one's pennies for drink, when the"
"12954",140,"working class was wandering in darkness, and waiting to be delivered;"
"12955",140,"the price of a glass of beer would buy fifty copies of a leaflet, and"
"12956",140,"one could hand these out to the unregenerate, and then get drunk upon"
"12957",140,"the thought of the good that was being accomplished. That was the way"
"12958",140,"the movement had been made, and it was the only way it would progress;"
"12959",140,"it availed nothing to know of it, without fighting for it--it was a"
"12960",140,"thing for all, not for a few! A corollary of this proposition of course"
"12961",140,"was, that any one who refused to receive the new gospel was personally"
"12962",140,"responsible for keeping Jurgis from his heart's desire; and this, alas,"
"12963",140,"made him uncomfortable as an acquaintance. He met some neighbors with"
"12964",140,"whom Elzbieta had made friends in her neighborhood, and he set out to"
"12965",140,"make Socialists of them by wholesale, and several times he all but got"
"12966",140,"into a fight."
"12967",140,""
"12968",140,"It was all so painfully obvious to Jurgis! It was so incomprehensible"
"12969",140,"how a man could fail to see it! Here were all the opportunities of the"
"12970",140,"country, the land, and the buildings upon the land, the railroads, the"
"12971",140,"mines, the factories, and the stores, all in the hands of a few private"
"12972",140,"individuals, called capitalists, for whom the people were obliged to"
"12973",140,"work for wages. The whole balance of what the people produced went to"
"12974",140,"heap up the fortunes of these capitalists, to heap, and heap again, and"
"12975",140,"yet again--and that in spite of the fact that they, and every one about"
"12976",140,"them, lived in unthinkable luxury! And was it not plain that if the"
"12977",140,"people cut off the share of those who merely ""owned,"" the share of those"
"12978",140,"who worked would be much greater? That was as plain as two and two makes"
"12979",140,"four; and it was the whole of it, absolutely the whole of it; and yet"
"12980",140,"there were people who could not see it, who would argue about everything"
"12981",140,"else in the world. They would tell you that governments could not manage"
"12982",140,"things as economically as private individuals; they would repeat and"
"12983",140,"repeat that, and think they were saying something! They could not see"
"12984",140,"that ""economical"" management by masters meant simply that they, the"
"12985",140,"people, were worked harder and ground closer and paid less! They were"
"12986",140,"wage-earners and servants, at the mercy of exploiters whose one thought"
"12987",140,"was to get as much out of them as possible; and they were taking"
"12988",140,"an interest in the process, were anxious lest it should not be done"
"12989",140,"thoroughly enough! Was it not honestly a trial to listen to an argument"
"12990",140,"such as that?"
"12991",140,""
"12992",140,"And yet there were things even worse. You would begin talking to some"
"12993",140,"poor devil who had worked in one shop for the last thirty years, and"
"12994",140,"had never been able to save a penny; who left home every morning at six"
"12995",140,"o'clock, to go and tend a machine, and come back at night too tired to"
"12996",140,"take his clothes off; who had never had a week's vacation in his life,"
"12997",140,"had never traveled, never had an adventure, never learned anything,"
"12998",140,"never hoped anything--and when you started to tell him about"
"12999",140,"Socialism he would sniff and say, ""I'm not interested in that--I'm an"
"13000",140,"individualist!"" And then he would go on to tell you that Socialism was"
"13001",140,"""paternalism,"" and that if it ever had its way the world would stop"
"13002",140,"progressing. It was enough to make a mule laugh, to hear arguments like"
"13003",140,"that; and yet it was no laughing matter, as you found out--for how many"
"13004",140,"millions of such poor deluded wretches there were, whose lives had been"
"13005",140,"so stunted by capitalism that they no longer knew what freedom was! And"
"13006",140,"they really thought that it was ""individualism"" for tens of thousands"
"13007",140,"of them to herd together and obey the orders of a steel magnate, and"
"13008",140,"produce hundreds of millions of dollars of wealth for him, and then let"
"13009",140,"him give them libraries; while for them to take the industry, and run it"
"13010",140,"to suit themselves, and build their own libraries--that would have been"
"13011",140,"""Paternalism""!"
"13012",140,""
"13013",140,"Sometimes the agony of such things as this was almost more than Jurgis"
"13014",140,"could bear; yet there was no way of escape from it, there was nothing"
"13015",140,"to do but to dig away at the base of this mountain of ignorance and"
"13016",140,"prejudice. You must keep at the poor fellow; you must hold your temper,"
"13017",140,"and argue with him, and watch for your chance to stick an idea or"
"13018",140,"two into his head. And the rest of the time you must sharpen up your"
"13019",140,"weapons--you must think out new replies to his objections, and provide"
"13020",140,"yourself with new facts to prove to him the folly of his ways."
"13021",140,""
"13022",140,"So Jurgis acquired the reading habit. He would carry in his pocket a"
"13023",140,"tract or a pamphlet which some one had loaned him, and whenever he had"
"13024",140,"an idle moment during the day he would plod through a paragraph, and"
"13025",140,"then think about it while he worked. Also he read the newspapers, and"
"13026",140,"asked questions about them. One of the other porters at Hinds's was a"
"13027",140,"sharp little Irishman, who knew everything that Jurgis wanted to know;"
"13028",140,"and while they were busy he would explain to him the geography of"
"13029",140,"America, and its history, its constitution and its laws; also he gave"
"13030",140,"him an idea of the business system of the country, the great railroads"
"13031",140,"and corporations, and who owned them, and the labor unions, and the big"
"13032",140,"strikes, and the men who had led them. Then at night, when he could get"
"13033",140,"off, Jurgis would attend the Socialist meetings. During the campaign one"
"13034",140,"was not dependent upon the street corner affairs, where the weather"
"13035",140,"and the quality of the orator were equally uncertain; there were"
"13036",140,"hall meetings every night, and one could hear speakers of national"
"13037",140,"prominence. These discussed the political situation from every point of"
"13038",140,"view, and all that troubled Jurgis was the impossibility of carrying off"
"13039",140,"but a small part of the treasures they offered him."
"13040",140,""
"13041",140,"There was a man who was known in the party as the ""Little Giant."" The"
"13042",140,"Lord had used up so much material in the making of his head that there"
"13043",140,"had not been enough to complete his legs; but he got about on the"
"13044",140,"platform, and when he shook his raven whiskers the pillars of capitalism"
"13045",140,"rocked. He had written a veritable encyclopedia upon the subject, a book"
"13046",140,"that was nearly as big as himself--And then there was a young"
"13047",140,"author, who came from California, and had been a salmon fisher, an"
"13048",140,"oyster-pirate, a longshoreman, a sailor; who had tramped the country and"
"13049",140,"been sent to jail, had lived in the Whitechapel slums, and been to the"
"13050",140,"Klondike in search of gold. All these things he pictured in his books,"
"13051",140,"and because he was a man of genius he forced the world to hear him. Now"
"13052",140,"he was famous, but wherever he went he still preached the gospel of"
"13053",140,"the poor. And then there was one who was known at the ""millionaire"
"13054",140,"Socialist."" He had made a fortune in business, and spent nearly all of"
"13055",140,"it in building up a magazine, which the post office department had tried"
"13056",140,"to suppress, and had driven to Canada. He was a quiet-mannered man, whom"
"13057",140,"you would have taken for anything in the world but a Socialist agitator."
"13058",140,"His speech was simple and informal--he could not understand why any"
"13059",140,"one should get excited about these things. It was a process of economic"
"13060",140,"evolution, he said, and he exhibited its laws and methods. Life was a"
"13061",140,"struggle for existence, and the strong overcame the weak, and in turn"
"13062",140,"were overcome by the strongest. Those who lost in the struggle were"
"13063",140,"generally exterminated; but now and then they had been known to save"
"13064",140,"themselves by combination--which was a new and higher kind of strength."
"13065",140,"It was so that the gregarious animals had overcome the predaceous; it"
"13066",140,"was so, in human history, that the people had mastered the kings. The"
"13067",140,"workers were simply the citizens of industry, and the Socialist movement"
"13068",140,"was the expression of their will to survive. The inevitability of the"
"13069",140,"revolution depended upon this fact, that they had no choice but to unite"
"13070",140,"or be exterminated; this fact, grim and inexorable, depended upon no"
"13071",140,"human will, it was the law of the economic process, of which the editor"
"13072",140,"showed the details with the most marvelous precision."
"13073",140,""
"13074",140,"And later on came the evening of the great meeting of the campaign, when"
"13075",140,"Jurgis heard the two standard-bearers of his party. Ten years before"
"13076",140,"there had been in Chicago a strike of a hundred and fifty thousand"
"13077",140,"railroad employees, and thugs had been hired by the railroads to commit"
"13078",140,"violence, and the President of the United States had sent in troops"
"13079",140,"to break the strike, by flinging the officers of the union into jail"
"13080",140,"without trial. The president of the union came out of his cell a ruined"
"13081",140,"man; but also he came out a Socialist; and now for just ten years he had"
"13082",140,"been traveling up and down the country, standing face to face with the"
"13083",140,"people, and pleading with them for justice. He was a man of electric"
"13084",140,"presence, tall and gaunt, with a face worn thin by struggle and"
"13085",140,"suffering. The fury of outraged manhood gleamed in it--and the tears of"
"13086",140,"suffering little children pleaded in his voice. When he spoke he paced"
"13087",140,"the stage, lithe and eager, like a panther. He leaned over, reaching out"
"13088",140,"for his audience; he pointed into their souls with an insistent finger."
"13089",140,"His voice was husky from much speaking, but the great auditorium was as"
"13090",140,"still as death, and every one heard him."
"13091",140,""
"13092",140,"And then, as Jurgis came out from this meeting, some one handed him"
"13093",140,"a paper which he carried home with him and read; and so he became"
"13094",140,"acquainted with the ""Appeal to Reason."" About twelve years previously a"
"13095",140,"Colorado real-estate speculator had made up his mind that it was wrong"
"13096",140,"to gamble in the necessities of life of human beings: and so he had"
"13097",140,"retired and begun the publication of a Socialist weekly. There had come"
"13098",140,"a time when he had to set his own type, but he had held on and won out,"
"13099",140,"and now his publication was an institution. It used a carload of paper"
"13100",140,"every week, and the mail trains would be hours loading up at the depot"
"13101",140,"of the little Kansas town. It was a four-page weekly, which sold for"
"13102",140,"less than half a cent a copy; its regular subscription list was a"
"13103",140,"quarter of a million, and it went to every crossroads post office in"
"13104",140,"America."
"13105",140,""
"13106",140,"The ""Appeal"" was a ""propaganda"" paper. It had a manner all its own--it"
"13107",140,"was full of ginger and spice, of Western slang and hustle: It collected"
"13108",140,"news of the doings of the ""plutes,"" and served it up for the benefit"
"13109",140,"of the ""American working-mule."" It would have columns of the deadly"
"13110",140,"parallel--the million dollars' worth of diamonds, or the fancy"
"13111",140,"pet-poodle establishment of a society dame, beside the fate of Mrs."
"13112",140,"Murphy of San Francisco, who had starved to death on the streets, or of"
"13113",140,"John Robinson, just out of the hospital, who had hanged himself in New"
"13114",140,"York because he could not find work. It collected the stories of graft"
"13115",140,"and misery from the daily press, and made a little pungent paragraphs"
"13116",140,"out of them. ""Three banks of Bungtown, South Dakota, failed, and"
"13117",140,"more savings of the workers swallowed up!"" ""The mayor of Sandy Creek,"
"13118",140,"Oklahoma, has skipped with a hundred thousand dollars. That's the kind"
"13119",140,"of rulers the old partyites give you!"" ""The president of the Florida"
"13120",140,"Flying Machine Company is in jail for bigamy. He was a prominent"
"13121",140,"opponent of Socialism, which he said would break up the home!"" The"
"13122",140,"""Appeal"" had what it called its ""Army,"" about thirty thousand of the"
"13123",140,"faithful, who did things for it; and it was always exhorting the ""Army"""
"13124",140,"to keep its dander up, and occasionally encouraging it with a prize"
"13125",140,"competition, for anything from a gold watch to a private yacht or an"
"13126",140,"eighty-acre farm. Its office helpers were all known to the ""Army"" by"
"13127",140,"quaint titles--""Inky Ike,"" ""the Bald-headed Man,"" ""the Redheaded Girl,"""
"13128",140,"""the Bulldog,"" ""the Office Goat,"" and ""the One Hoss."""
"13129",140,""
"13130",140,"But sometimes, again, the ""Appeal"" would be desperately serious. It sent"
"13131",140,"a correspondent to Colorado, and printed pages describing the overthrow"
"13132",140,"of American institutions in that state. In a certain city of the country"
"13133",140,"it had over forty of its ""Army"" in the headquarters of the Telegraph"
"13134",140,"Trust, and no message of importance to Socialists ever went through that"
"13135",140,"a copy of it did not go to the ""Appeal."" It would print great broadsides"
"13136",140,"during the campaign; one copy that came to Jurgis was a manifesto"
"13137",140,"addressed to striking workingmen, of which nearly a million copies had"
"13138",140,"been distributed in the industrial centers, wherever the employers'"
"13139",140,"associations had been carrying out their ""open shop"" program. ""You have"
"13140",140,"lost the strike!"" it was headed. ""And now what are you going to do about"
"13141",140,"it?"" It was what is called an ""incendiary"" appeal--it was written by a"
"13142",140,"man into whose soul the iron had entered. When this edition appeared,"
"13143",140,"twenty thousand copies were sent to the stockyards district; and they"
"13144",140,"were taken out and stowed away in the rear of a little cigar store, and"
"13145",140,"every evening, and on Sundays, the members of the Packingtown locals"
"13146",140,"would get armfuls and distribute them on the streets and in the houses."
"13147",140,"The people of Packingtown had lost their strike, if ever a people had,"
"13148",140,"and so they read these papers gladly, and twenty thousand were hardly"
"13149",140,"enough to go round. Jurgis had resolved not to go near his old home"
"13150",140,"again, but when he heard of this it was too much for him, and every"
"13151",140,"night for a week he would get on the car and ride out to the stockyards,"
"13152",140,"and help to undo his work of the previous year, when he had sent Mike"
"13153",140,"Scully's ten-pin setter to the city Board of Aldermen."
"13154",140,""
"13155",140,"It was quite marvelous to see what a difference twelve months had"
"13156",140,"made in Packingtown--the eyes of the people were getting opened! The"
"13157",140,"Socialists were literally sweeping everything before them that election,"
"13158",140,"and Scully and the Cook County machine were at their wits' end for an"
"13159",140,"""issue."" At the very close of the campaign they bethought themselves of"
"13160",140,"the fact that the strike had been broken by Negroes, and so they sent"
"13161",140,"for a South Carolina fire-eater, the ""pitchfork senator,"" as he was"
"13162",140,"called, a man who took off his coat when he talked to workingmen,"
"13163",140,"and damned and swore like a Hessian. This meeting they advertised"
"13164",140,"extensively, and the Socialists advertised it too--with the result"
"13165",140,"that about a thousand of them were on hand that evening. The ""pitchfork"
"13166",140,"senator"" stood their fusillade of questions for about an hour, and then"
"13167",140,"went home in disgust, and the balance of the meeting was a strictly"
"13168",140,"party affair. Jurgis, who had insisted upon coming, had the time of"
"13169",140,"his life that night; he danced about and waved his arms in his"
"13170",140,"excitement--and at the very climax he broke loose from his friends,"
"13171",140,"and got out into the aisle, and proceeded to make a speech himself! The"
"13172",140,"senator had been denying that the Democratic party was corrupt; it"
"13173",140,"was always the Republicans who bought the votes, he said--and here was"
"13174",140,"Jurgis shouting furiously, ""It's a lie! It's a lie!"" After which he went"
"13175",140,"on to tell them how he knew it--that he knew it because he had bought"
"13176",140,"them himself! And he would have told the ""pitchfork senator"" all his"
"13177",140,"experiences, had not Harry Adams and a friend grabbed him about the neck"

"13184",140,"One of the first things that Jurgis had done after he got a job was to"
"13185",140,"go and see Marija. She came down into the basement of the house to meet"
"13186",140,"him, and he stood by the door with his hat in his hand, saying, ""I've"

"13189",140,"But Marija only shook her head. There was nothing else for her to"

"13191",140,"secret--girls had tried it, and they were always found out. There were"
"13192",140,"thousands of men who came to this place, and sooner or later she would"
"13193",140,"meet one of them. ""And besides,"" Marija added, ""I can't do anything. I'm"
"13194",140,"no good--I take dope. What could you do with me?"""
"13195",140,""
"13196",140,"""Can't you stop?"" Jurgis cried."
"13197",140,""
"13198",140,"""No,"" she answered, ""I'll never stop. What's the use of talking about"
"13199",140,"it--I'll stay here till I die, I guess. It's all I'm fit for."" And that"
"13200",140,"was all that he could get her to say--there was no use trying. When"
"13201",140,"he told her he would not let Elzbieta take her money, she answered"
"13202",140,"indifferently: ""Then it'll be wasted here--that's all."" Her eyelids"
"13203",140,"looked heavy and her face was red and swollen; he saw that he was"
"13204",140,"annoying her, that she only wanted him to go away. So he went,"
"13205",140,"disappointed and sad."
"13206",140,""
"13207",140,"Poor Jurgis was not very happy in his home-life. Elzbieta was sick a"
"13208",140,"good deal now, and the boys were wild and unruly, and very much the"
"13209",140,"worse for their life upon the streets. But he stuck by the family"
"13210",140,"nevertheless, for they reminded him of his old happiness; and when"
"13211",140,"things went wrong he could solace himself with a plunge into the"
"13212",140,"Socialist movement. Since his life had been caught up into the current"
"13213",140,"of this great stream, things which had before been the whole of life"
"13214",140,"to him came to seem of relatively slight importance; his interests were"
"13215",140,"elsewhere, in the world of ideas. His outward life was commonplace and"
"13216",140,"uninteresting; he was just a hotel-porter, and expected to remain one"
"13217",140,"while he lived; but meantime, in the realm of thought, his life was a"
"13218",140,"perpetual adventure. There was so much to know--so many wonders to"
"13219",140,"be discovered! Never in all his life did Jurgis forget the day before"
"13220",140,"election, when there came a telephone message from a friend of Harry"
"13221",140,"Adams, asking him to bring Jurgis to see him that night; and Jurgis"
"13222",140,"went, and met one of the minds of the movement."
"13223",140,""
"13224",140,"The invitation was from a man named Fisher, a Chicago millionaire who"
"13225",140,"had given up his life to settlement work, and had a little home in the"
"13226",140,"heart of the city's slums. He did not belong to the party, but he was"
"13227",140,"in sympathy with it; and he said that he was to have as his guest that"
"13228",140,"night the editor of a big Eastern magazine, who wrote against Socialism,"
"13229",140,"but really did not know what it was. The millionaire suggested that"
"13230",140,"Adams bring Jurgis along, and then start up the subject of ""pure food,"""
"13231",140,"in which the editor was interested."
"13232",140,""
"13233",140,"Young Fisher's home was a little two-story brick house, dingy and"
"13234",140,"weather-beaten outside, but attractive within. The room that Jurgis saw"
"13235",140,"was half lined with books, and upon the walls were many pictures, dimly"
"13236",140,"visible in the soft, yellow light; it was a cold, rainy night, so a"
"13237",140,"log fire was crackling in the open hearth. Seven or eight people were"
"13238",140,"gathered about it when Adams and his friend arrived, and Jurgis saw to"
"13239",140,"his dismay that three of them were ladies. He had never talked to people"
"13240",140,"of this sort before, and he fell into an agony of embarrassment. He"
"13241",140,"stood in the doorway clutching his hat tightly in his hands, and made a"
"13242",140,"deep bow to each of the persons as he was introduced; then, when he was"
"13243",140,"asked to have a seat, he took a chair in a dark corner, and sat down"
"13244",140,"upon the edge of it, and wiped the perspiration off his forehead with"
"13245",140,"his sleeve. He was terrified lest they should expect him to talk."
"13246",140,""
"13247",140,"There was the host himself, a tall, athletic young man, clad in evening"
"13248",140,"dress, as also was the editor, a dyspeptic-looking gentleman named"
"13249",140,"Maynard. There was the former's frail young wife, and also an elderly"
"13250",140,"lady, who taught kindergarten in the settlement, and a young college"
"13251",140,"student, a beautiful girl with an intense and earnest face. She only"
"13252",140,"spoke once or twice while Jurgis was there--the rest of the time she sat"
"13253",140,"by the table in the center of the room, resting her chin in her hands"
"13254",140,"and drinking in the conversation. There were two other men, whom young"
"13255",140,"Fisher had introduced to Jurgis as Mr. Lucas and Mr. Schliemann; he"
"13256",140,"heard them address Adams as ""Comrade,"" and so he knew that they were"

"13258",140,""
"13259",140,"The one called Lucas was a mild and meek-looking little gentleman of"

"13262",140,"He traveled all over the country, living like the apostles of old, upon"
"13263",140,"hospitality, and preaching upon street-corners when there was no hall."
"13264",140,"The other man had been in the midst of a discussion with the editor when"
"13265",140,"Adams and Jurgis came in; and at the suggestion of the host they resumed"
"13266",140,"it after the interruption. Jurgis was soon sitting spellbound, thinking"
"13267",140,"that here was surely the strangest man that had ever lived in the world."
"13268",140,""
"13269",140,"Nicholas Schliemann was a Swede, a tall, gaunt person, with hairy hands"
"13270",140,"and bristling yellow beard; he was a university man, and had been a"
"13271",140,"professor of philosophy--until, as he said, he had found that he was"
"13272",140,"selling his character as well as his time. Instead he had come to"
"13273",140,"America, where he lived in a garret room in this slum district, and made"
"13274",140,"volcanic energy take the place of fire. He studied the composition of"
"13275",140,"food-stuffs, and knew exactly how many proteids and carbohydrates his"
"13276",140,"body needed; and by scientific chewing he said that he tripled the value"
"13277",140,"of all he ate, so that it cost him eleven cents a day. About the first"
"13278",140,"of July he would leave Chicago for his vacation, on foot; and when he"
"13279",140,"struck the harvest fields he would set to work for two dollars and a"
"13280",140,"half a day, and come home when he had another year's supply--a hundred"
"13281",140,"and twenty-five dollars. That was the nearest approach to independence"
"13282",140,"a man could make ""under capitalism,"" he explained; he would never marry,"
"13283",140,"for no sane man would allow himself to fall in love until after the"
"13284",140,"revolution."
"13285",140,""
"13286",140,"He sat in a big arm-chair, with his legs crossed, and his head so far in"
"13287",140,"the shadow that one saw only two glowing lights, reflected from the fire"
"13288",140,"on the hearth. He spoke simply, and utterly without emotion; with the"
"13289",140,"manner of a teacher setting forth to a group of scholars an axiom in"
"13290",140,"geometry, he would enunciate such propositions as made the hair of"
"13291",140,"an ordinary person rise on end. And when the auditor had asserted"
"13292",140,"his non-comprehension, he would proceed to elucidate by some new"
"13293",140,"proposition, yet more appalling. To Jurgis the Herr Dr. Schliemann"
"13294",140,"assumed the proportions of a thunderstorm or an earthquake. And yet,"
"13295",140,"strange as it might seem, there was a subtle bond between them, and he"
"13296",140,"could follow the argument nearly all the time. He was carried over the"
"13297",140,"difficult places in spite of himself; and he went plunging away in mad"
"13298",140,"career--a very Mazeppa-ride upon the wild horse Speculation."
"13299",140,""
"13300",140,"Nicholas Schliemann was familiar with all the universe, and with man"
"13301",140,"as a small part of it. He understood human institutions, and blew them"
"13302",140,"about like soap bubbles. It was surprising that so much destructiveness"
"13303",140,"could be contained in one human mind. Was it government? The purpose"
"13304",140,"of government was the guarding of property-rights, the perpetuation"
"13305",140,"of ancient force and modern fraud. Or was it marriage? Marriage"
"13306",140,"and prostitution were two sides of one shield, the predatory man's"
"13307",140,"exploitation of the sex-pleasure. The difference between them was a"
"13308",140,"difference of class. If a woman had money she might dictate her own"
"13309",140,"terms: equality, a life contract, and the legitimacy--that is, the"
"13310",140,"property-rights--of her children. If she had no money, she was a"
"13311",140,"proletarian, and sold herself for an existence. And then the subject"
"13312",140,"became Religion, which was the Archfiend's deadliest weapon. Government"
"13313",140,"oppressed the body of the wage-slave, but Religion oppressed his mind,"
"13314",140,"and poisoned the stream of progress at its source. The working-man was"
"13315",140,"to fix his hopes upon a future life, while his pockets were picked in"
"13316",140,"this one; he was brought up to frugality, humility, obedience--in short"
"13317",140,"to all the pseudo-virtues of capitalism. The destiny of civilization"
"13318",140,"would be decided in one final death struggle between the Red"
"13319",140,"International and the Black, between Socialism and the Roman Catholic"

"13399",140,"politics, comrade. Here is an historical figure whom all men reverence"
"13400",140,"and love, whom some regard as divine; and who was one of us--who lived"
"13401",140,"our life, and taught our doctrine. And now shall we leave him in the"
"13402",140,"hands of his enemies--shall we allow them to stifle and stultify his"
"13403",140,"example? We have his words, which no one can deny; and shall we not"
"13404",140,"quote them to the people, and prove to them what he was, and what he"
"13405",140,"taught, and what he did? No, no, a thousand times no!--we shall use his"
"13406",140,"authority to turn out the knaves and sluggards from his ministry, and we"
"13407",140,"shall yet rouse the people to action!--"""
"13408",140,""
"13409",140,"Lucas halted again; and the other stretched out his hand to a paper on"
"13410",140,"the table. ""Here, comrade,"" he said, with a laugh, ""here is a place for"
"13411",140,"you to begin. A bishop whose wife has just been robbed of fifty thousand"
"13412",140,"dollars' worth of diamonds! And a most unctuous and oily of bishops!"
"13413",140,"An eminent and scholarly bishop! A philanthropist and friend of labor"
"13414",140,"bishop--a Civic Federation decoy duck for the chloroforming of the"
"13415",140,"wage-working-man!"""
"13416",140,""
"13417",140,"To this little passage of arms the rest of the company sat as"
"13418",140,"spectators. But now Mr. Maynard, the editor, took occasion to remark,"
"13419",140,"somewhat naively, that he had always understood that Socialists had a"
"13420",140,"cut-and-dried program for the future of civilization; whereas here were"
"13421",140,"two active members of the party, who, from what he could make out, were"
"13422",140,"agreed about nothing at all. Would the two, for his enlightenment, try"
"13423",140,"to ascertain just what they had in common, and why they belonged to the"
"13424",140,"same party? This resulted, after much debating, in the formulating of"
"13425",140,"two carefully worded propositions: First, that a Socialist believes in"
"13426",140,"the common ownership and democratic management of the means of producing"
"13427",140,"the necessities of life; and, second, that a Socialist believes that"
"13428",140,"the means by which this is to be brought about is the class conscious"
"13429",140,"political organization of the wage-earners. Thus far they were at"
"13430",140,"one; but no farther. To Lucas, the religious zealot, the co-operative"
"13431",140,"commonwealth was the New Jerusalem, the kingdom of Heaven, which is"
"13432",140,"""within you."" To the other, Socialism was simply a necessary step toward"
"13433",140,"a far-distant goal, a step to be tolerated with impatience. Schliemann"
"13434",140,"called himself a ""philosophic anarchist""; and he explained that an"
"13435",140,"anarchist was one who believed that the end of human existence was the"
"13436",140,"free development of every personality, unrestricted by laws save those"
"13437",140,"of its own being. Since the same kind of match would light every one's"
"13438",140,"fire and the same-shaped loaf of bread would fill every one's stomach,"
"13439",140,"it would be perfectly feasible to submit industry to the control of a"
"13440",140,"majority vote. There was only one earth, and the quantity of material"
"13441",140,"things was limited. Of intellectual and moral things, on the other hand,"
"13442",140,"there was no limit, and one could have more without another's"
"13443",140,"having less; hence ""Communism in material production, anarchism in"
"13444",140,"intellectual,"" was the formula of modern proletarian thought. As soon"
"13445",140,"as the birth agony was over, and the wounds of society had been healed,"
"13446",140,"there would be established a simple system whereby each man was credited"
"13447",140,"with his labor and debited with his purchases; and after that the"
"13448",140,"processes of production, exchange, and consumption would go on"
"13449",140,"automatically, and without our being conscious of them, any more than"
"13450",140,"a man is conscious of the beating of his heart. And then, explained"
"13451",140,"Schliemann, society would break up into independent, self-governing"
"13452",140,"communities of mutually congenial persons; examples of which at present"
"13453",140,"were clubs, churches, and political parties. After the revolution, all"
"13454",140,"the intellectual, artistic, and spiritual activities of men would be"
"13455",140,"cared for by such ""free associations""; romantic novelists would be"
"13456",140,"supported by those who liked to read romantic novels, and impressionist"
"13457",140,"painters would be supported by those who liked to look at impressionist"
"13458",140,"pictures--and the same with preachers and scientists, editors and actors"
"13459",140,"and musicians. If any one wanted to work or paint or pray, and could"
"13460",140,"find no one to maintain him, he could support himself by working part of"
"13461",140,"the time. That was the case at present, the only difference being that"
"13462",140,"the competitive wage system compelled a man to work all the time to"
"13463",140,"live, while, after the abolition of privilege and exploitation, any"
"13464",140,"one would be able to support himself by an hour's work a day. Also the"
"13465",140,"artist's audience of the present was a small minority of people, all"
"13466",140,"debased and vulgarized by the effort it had cost them to win in the"
"13467",140,"commercial battle, of the intellectual and artistic activities which"
"13468",140,"would result when the whole of mankind was set free from the nightmare"
"13469",140,"of competition, we could at present form no conception whatever."
"13470",140,""
"13471",140,"And then the editor wanted to know upon what ground Dr. Schliemann"
"13472",140,"asserted that it might be possible for a society to exist upon an hour's"
"13473",140,"toil by each of its members. ""Just what,"" answered the other, ""would be"
"13474",140,"the productive capacity of society if the present resources of science"
"13475",140,"were utilized, we have no means of ascertaining; but we may be sure it"
"13476",140,"would exceed anything that would sound reasonable to minds inured to"
"13477",140,"the ferocious barbarities of capitalism. After the triumph of the"
"13478",140,"international proletariat, war would of course be inconceivable; and"
"13479",140,"who can figure the cost of war to humanity--not merely the value of the"
"13480",140,"lives and the material that it destroys, not merely the cost of keeping"
"13481",140,"millions of men in idleness, of arming and equipping them for battle"
"13482",140,"and parade, but the drain upon the vital energies of society by the"
"13483",140,"war attitude and the war terror, the brutality and ignorance, the"
"13484",140,"drunkenness, prostitution, and crime it entails, the industrial"
"13485",140,"impotence and the moral deadness? Do you think that it would be too much"
"13486",140,"to say that two hours of the working time of every efficient member of a"
"13487",140,"community goes to feed the red fiend of war?"""
"13488",140,""
"13489",140,"And then Schliemann went on to outline some of the wastes of"
"13490",140,"competition: the losses of industrial warfare; the ceaseless worry and"
"13491",140,"friction; the vices--such as drink, for instance, the use of which had"
"13492",140,"nearly doubled in twenty years, as a consequence of the intensification"
"13493",140,"of the economic struggle; the idle and unproductive members of the"
"13494",140,"community, the frivolous rich and the pauperized poor; the law and the"
"13495",140,"whole machinery of repression; the wastes of social ostentation, the"
"13496",140,"milliners and tailors, the hairdressers, dancing masters, chefs and"
"13497",140,"lackeys. ""You understand,"" he said, ""that in a society dominated by"
"13498",140,"the fact of commercial competition, money is necessarily the test of"
"13499",140,"prowess, and wastefulness the sole criterion of power. So we have,"
"13500",140,"at the present moment, a society with, say, thirty per cent of the"
"13501",140,"population occupied in producing useless articles, and one per cent"
"13502",140,"occupied in destroying them. And this is not all; for the servants"
"13503",140,"and panders of the parasites are also parasites, the milliners and the"
"13504",140,"jewelers and the lackeys have also to be supported by the useful members"
"13505",140,"of the community. And bear in mind also that this monstrous disease"
"13506",140,"affects not merely the idlers and their menials, its poison penetrates"
"13507",140,"the whole social body. Beneath the hundred thousand women of the elite"
"13508",140,"are a million middle-class women, miserable because they are not of the"
"13509",140,"elite, and trying to appear of it in public; and beneath them, in turn,"
"13510",140,"are five million farmers' wives reading 'fashion papers' and trimming"
"13511",140,"bonnets, and shop-girls and serving-maids selling themselves into"
"13512",140,"brothels for cheap jewelry and imitation seal-skin robes. And then"
"13513",140,"consider that, added to this competition in display, you have, like"
"13514",140,"oil on the flames, a whole system of competition in selling! You have"
"13515",140,"manufacturers contriving tens of thousands of catchpenny devices,"
"13516",140,"storekeepers displaying them, and newspapers and magazines filled up"
"13517",140,"with advertisements of them!"""

"13521",140,"""When one comes to the ultra-modern profession of advertising,"""
"13522",140,"responded Schliemann--""the science of persuading people to buy what they"
"13523",140,"do not want--he is in the very center of the ghastly charnel house"

"13525",140,"horrors to point out first. But consider the waste in time and energy"

"13535",140,""
"13536",140,"""Precisely,"" said Schliemann; ""the low knavery and the ferocious cruelty"
"13537",140,"incidental to them, the plotting and the lying and the bribing, the"
"13538",140,"blustering and bragging, the screaming egotism, the hurrying and"
"13539",140,"worrying. Of course, imitation and adulteration are the essence of"
"13540",140,"competition--they are but another form of the phrase 'to buy in the"
"13541",140,"cheapest market and sell in the dearest.' A government official has"
"13542",140,"stated that the nation suffers a loss of a billion and a quarter dollars"
"13543",140,"a year through adulterated foods; which means, of course, not only"
"13544",140,"materials wasted that might have been useful outside of the human"
"13545",140,"stomach, but doctors and nurses for people who would otherwise have"
"13546",140,"been well, and undertakers for the whole human race ten or twenty years"
"13547",140,"before the proper time. Then again, consider the waste of time and"
"13548",140,"energy required to sell these things in a dozen stores, where one would"
"13549",140,"do. There are a million or two of business firms in the country,"

"13555",140,"studying to circumvent them, the pettifogging and chicanery, the hatreds"
"13556",140,"and lies! Consider the wastes incidental to the blind and haphazard"
"13557",140,"production of commodities--the factories closed, the workers idle,"
"13558",140,"the goods spoiling in storage; consider the activities of the stock"
"13559",140,"manipulator, the paralyzing of whole industries, the overstimulation of"
"13560",140,"others, for speculative purposes; the assignments and bank failures,"

"13649",140,"Now set aside the modern system of pneumatic house-cleaning, and the"
"13650",140,"economies of co-operative cooking; and consider one single item, the"
"13651",140,"washing of dishes. Surely it is moderate to say that the dish-washing"
"13652",140,"for a family of five takes half an hour a day; with ten hours as a day's"
"13653",140,"work, it takes, therefore, half a million able-bodied persons--mostly"
"13654",140,"women to do the dish-washing of the country. And note that this is most"

"13656",140,"nervousness, ugliness, and ill-temper; of prostitution, suicide, and"
"13657",140,"insanity; of drunken husbands and degenerate children--for all of which"
"13658",140,"things the community has naturally to pay. And now consider that in each"
"13659",140,"of my little free communities there would be a machine which would wash"
"13660",140,"and dry the dishes, and do it, not merely to the eye and the touch,"
"13661",140,"but scientifically--sterilizing them--and do it at a saving of all the"
"13662",140,"drudgery and nine-tenths of the time! All of these things you may"
"13663",140,"find in the books of Mrs. Gilman; and then take Kropotkin's Fields,"
"13664",140,"Factories, and Workshops, and read about the new science of agriculture,"
"13665",140,"which has been built up in the last ten years; by which, with made soils"

"13682",140,"furrow, cutting and dropping and covering the potatoes, and planting a"
"13683",140,"score of acres a day! To picture the great potato-digging machine,"
"13684",140,"run by electricity, perhaps, and moving across a thousand-acre field,"
"13685",140,"scooping up earth and potatoes, and dropping the latter into sacks! To"
"13686",140,"every other kind of vegetable and fruit handled in the same way--apples"
"13687",140,"and oranges picked by machinery, cows milked by electricity--things"
"13688",140,"which are already done, as you may know. To picture the harvest fields"
"13689",140,"of the future, to which millions of happy men and women come for a"
"13690",140,"summer holiday, brought by special trains, the exactly needful number to"
"13691",140,"each place! And to contrast all this with our present agonizing system"
"13692",140,"of independent small farming,--a stunted, haggard, ignorant man, mated"
"13693",140,"with a yellow, lean, and sad-eyed drudge, and toiling from four o'clock"
"13694",140,"in the morning until nine at night, working the children as soon as they"
"13695",140,"are able to walk, scratching the soil with its primitive tools, and shut"
"13696",140,"out from all knowledge and hope, from all their benefits of science and"
"13697",140,"invention, and all the joys of the spirit--held to a bare existence"
"13698",140,"by competition in labor, and boasting of his freedom because he is too"
"13699",140,"blind to see his chains!"""
"13700",140,""
"13701",140,"Dr. Schliemann paused a moment. ""And then,"" he continued, ""place"
"13702",140,"beside this fact of an unlimited food supply, the newest discovery of"
"13703",140,"physiologists, that most of the ills of the human system are due to"
"13704",140,"overfeeding! And then again, it has been proven that meat is unnecessary"
"13705",140,"as a food; and meat is obviously more difficult to produce than"
"13706",140,"vegetable food, less pleasant to prepare and handle, and more likely"
"13707",140,"to be unclean. But what of that, so long as it tickles the palate more"
"13708",140,"strongly?"""
"13709",140,""
"13710",140,"""How would Socialism change that?"" asked the girl-student, quickly. It"
"13711",140,"was the first time she had spoken."
"13712",140,""
"13713",140,"""So long as we have wage slavery,"" answered Schliemann, ""it matters not"
"13714",140,"in the least how debasing and repulsive a task may be, it is easy to"
"13715",140,"find people to perform it. But just as soon as labor is set free, then"
"13716",140,"the price of such work will begin to rise. So one by one the old, dingy,"
"13717",140,"and unsanitary factories will come down--it will be cheaper to build"
"13718",140,"new; and so the steamships will be provided with stoking machinery, and"
"13719",140,"so the dangerous trades will be made safe, or substitutes will be found"
"13720",140,"for their products. In exactly the same way, as the citizens of"
"13721",140,"our Industrial Republic become refined, year by year the cost of"
"13722",140,"slaughterhouse products will increase; until eventually those who want"
"13723",140,"to eat meat will have to do their own killing--and how long do you think"
"13724",140,"the custom would survive then?--To go on to another item--one of the"
"13725",140,"necessary accompaniments of capitalism in a democracy is political"
"13726",140,"corruption; and one of the consequences of civic administration by"
"13727",140,"ignorant and vicious politicians, is that preventable diseases kill off"
"13728",140,"half our population. And even if science were allowed to try, it could"
"13729",140,"do little, because the majority of human beings are not yet human beings"
"13730",140,"at all, but simply machines for the creating of wealth for others. They"
"13731",140,"are penned up in filthy houses and left to rot and stew in misery, and"
"13732",140,"the conditions of their life make them ill faster than all the doctors"
"13733",140,"in the world could heal them; and so, of course, they remain as centers"
"13734",140,"of contagion, poisoning the lives of all of us, and making happiness"
"13735",140,"impossible for even the most selfish. For this reason I would seriously"
"13736",140,"maintain that all the medical and surgical discoveries that science can"
"13737",140,"make in the future will be of less importance than the application of"
"13738",140,"the knowledge we already possess, when the disinherited of the earth"
"13739",140,"have established their right to a human existence."""
"13740",140,""
"13741",140,"And here the Herr Doctor relapsed into silence again. Jurgis had noticed"
"13742",140,"that the beautiful young girl who sat by the center-table was listening"
"13743",140,"with something of the same look that he himself had worn, the time when"
"13744",140,"he had first discovered Socialism. Jurgis would have liked to talk to"
"13745",140,"her, he felt sure that she would have understood him. Later on in the"
"13746",140,"evening, when the group broke up, he heard Mrs. Fisher say to her, in"
"13747",140,"a low voice, ""I wonder if Mr. Maynard will still write the same things"
"13748",140,"about Socialism""; to which she answered, ""I don't know--but if he does"
"13749",140,"we shall know that he is a knave!"""
"13750",140,""
"13751",140,""
"13752",140,"And only a few hours after this came election day--when the long"
"13753",140,"campaign was over, and the whole country seemed to stand still and hold"
"13754",140,"its breath, awaiting the issue. Jurgis and the rest of the staff of"
"13755",140,"Hinds's Hotel could hardly stop to finish their dinner, before they"
"13756",140,"hurried off to the big hall which the party had hired for that evening."
"13757",140,""
"13758",140,"But already there were people waiting, and already the telegraph"
"13759",140,"instrument on the stage had begun clicking off the returns. When the"
"13760",140,"final accounts were made up, the Socialist vote proved to be over four"
"13761",140,"hundred thousand--an increase of something like three hundred and fifty"
"13762",140,"per cent in four years. And that was doing well; but the party was"
"13763",140,"dependent for its early returns upon messages from the locals, and"
"13764",140,"naturally those locals which had been most successful were the ones"
"13765",140,"which felt most like reporting; and so that night every one in the hall"
"13766",140,"believed that the vote was going to be six, or seven, or even eight"
"13767",140,"hundred thousand. Just such an incredible increase had actually been"
"13768",140,"made in Chicago, and in the state; the vote of the city had been 6,700"
"13769",140,"in 1900, and now it was 47,000; that of Illinois had been 9,600, and"
"13770",140,"now it was 69,000! So, as the evening waxed, and the crowd piled in, the"
"13771",140,"meeting was a sight to be seen. Bulletins would be read, and the people"
"13772",140,"would shout themselves hoarse--and then some one would make a speech,"
"13773",140,"and there would be more shouting; and then a brief silence, and more"
"13774",140,"bulletins. There would come messages from the secretaries of neighboring"
"13775",140,"states, reporting their achievements; the vote of Indiana had gone from"
"13776",140,"2,300 to 12,000, of Wisconsin from 7,000 to 28,000; of Ohio from 4,800"
"13777",140,"to 36,000! There were telegrams to the national office from enthusiastic"
"13778",140,"individuals in little towns which had made amazing and unprecedented"
"13779",140,"increases in a single year: Benedict, Kansas, from 26 to 260; Henderson,"
"13780",140,"Kentucky, from 19 to 111; Holland, Michigan, from 14 to 208; Cleo,"
"13781",140,"Oklahoma, from 0 to 104; Martin's Ferry, Ohio, from 0 to 296--and many"
"13782",140,"more of the same kind. There were literally hundreds of such towns;"
"13783",140,"there would be reports from half a dozen of them in a single batch of"
"13784",140,"telegrams. And the men who read the despatches off to the audience were"
"13785",140,"old campaigners, who had been to the places and helped to make the"
"13786",140,"vote, and could make appropriate comments: Quincy, Illinois, from 189 to"
"13787",140,"831--that was where the mayor had arrested a Socialist speaker! Crawford"
"13788",140,"County, Kansas, from 285 to 1,975; that was the home of the ""Appeal"
"13789",140,"to Reason""! Battle Creek, Michigan, from 4,261 to 10,184; that was the"
"13790",140,"answer of labor to the Citizens' Alliance Movement!"
"13791",140,""
"13792",140,"And then there were official returns from the various precincts and"
"13793",140,"wards of the city itself! Whether it was a factory district or one of"
"13794",140,"the ""silk-stocking"" wards seemed to make no particular difference in the"
"13795",140,"increase; but one of the things which surprised the party leaders"
"13796",140,"most was the tremendous vote that came rolling in from the stockyards."
"13797",140,"Packingtown comprised three wards of the city, and the vote in the"
"13798",140,"spring of 1903 had been 500, and in the fall of the same year, 1,600."
"13799",140,"Now, only one year later, it was over 6,300--and the Democratic vote"
"13800",140,"only 8,800! There were other wards in which the Democratic vote had"
"13801",140,"been actually surpassed, and in two districts, members of the state"
"13802",140,"legislature had been elected. Thus Chicago now led the country; it had"
"13803",140,"set a new standard for the party, it had shown the workingmen the way!"
"13804",140,""
"13805",140,"--So spoke an orator upon the platform; and two thousand pairs of eyes"
"13806",140,"were fixed upon him, and two thousand voices were cheering his every"
"13807",140,"sentence. The orator had been the head of the city's relief bureau in"
"13808",140,"the stockyards, until the sight of misery and corruption had made him"
"13809",140,"sick. He was young, hungry-looking, full of fire; and as he swung his"
"13810",140,"long arms and beat up the crowd, to Jurgis he seemed the very spirit of"
"13811",140,"the revolution. ""Organize! Organize! Organize!""--that was his cry. He"
"13812",140,"was afraid of this tremendous vote, which his party had not expected,"
"13813",140,"and which it had not earned. ""These men are not Socialists!"" he cried."
"13814",140,"""This election will pass, and the excitement will die, and people will"
"13815",140,"forget about it; and if you forget about it, too, if you sink back and"
"13816",140,"rest upon your oars, we shall lose this vote that we have polled to-day,"
"13817",140,"and our enemies will laugh us to scorn! It rests with you to take your"
"13818",140,"resolution--now, in the flush of victory, to find these men who have"
"13819",140,"voted for us, and bring them to our meetings, and organize them and bind"
"13820",140,"them to us! We shall not find all our campaigns as easy as this one."
"13821",140,"Everywhere in the country tonight the old party politicians are studying"
"13822",140,"this vote, and setting their sails by it; and nowhere will they be"
"13823",140,"quicker or more cunning than here in our own city. Fifty thousand"
"13824",140,"Socialist votes in Chicago means a municipal-ownership Democracy in the"
"13825",140,"spring! And then they will fool the voters once more, and all the powers"
"13826",140,"of plunder and corruption will be swept into office again! But whatever"
"13827",140,"they may do when they get in, there is one thing they will not do, and"
"13828",140,"that will be the thing for which they were elected! They will not give"
"13829",140,"the people of our city municipal ownership--they will not mean to do it,"
"13830",140,"they will not try to do it; all that they will do is give our party"
"13831",140,"in Chicago the greatest opportunity that has ever come to Socialism"
"13832",140,"in America! We shall have the sham reformers self-stultified and"
"13833",140,"self-convicted; we shall have the radical Democracy left without a lie"
"13834",140,"with which to cover its nakedness! And then will begin the rush that"
"13835",140,"will never be checked, the tide that will never turn till it has reached"
"13836",140,"its flood--that will be irresistible, overwhelming--the rallying of the"
"13837",140,"outraged workingmen of Chicago to our standard! And we shall organize"
"13838",140,"them, we shall drill them, we shall marshal them for the victory! We"
"13839",140,"shall bear down the opposition, we shall sweep if before us--and Chicago"
"13840",140,"will be ours! Chicago will be ours! CHICAGO WILL BE OURS!"""
