"16",46,"with the season, or with me.  May it haunt their houses"

"35",46,"STAVE I:  MARLEY'S GHOST"
"36",46,""
"37",46,"MARLEY was dead: to begin with. There is no doubt"
"38",46,"whatever about that. The register of his burial was"
"39",46,"signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker,"
"40",46,"and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it: and"
"41",46,"Scrooge's name was good upon 'Change, for anything he"
"42",46,"chose to put his hand to. Old Marley was as dead as a"
"43",46,"door-nail."
"44",46,""
"45",46,"Mind! I don't mean to say that I know, of my"
"46",46,"own knowledge, what there is particularly dead about"
"47",46,"a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself, to"
"48",46,"regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery"
"49",46,"in the trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors"
"50",46,"is in the simile; and my unhallowed hands"
"51",46,"shall not disturb it, or the Country's done for. You"
"52",46,"will therefore permit me to repeat, emphatically, that"
"53",46,"Marley was as dead as a door-nail."
"54",46,""
"55",46,"Scrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did."
"56",46,"How could it be otherwise? Scrooge and he were"
"57",46,"partners for I don't know how many years. Scrooge"
"58",46,"was his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole"
"59",46,"assign, his sole residuary legatee, his sole friend, and"
"60",46,"sole mourner. And even Scrooge was not so dreadfully"
"61",46,"cut up by the sad event, but that he was an excellent"
"62",46,"man of business on the very day of the funeral,"
"63",46,"and solemnised it with an undoubted bargain."
"64",46,""
"65",46,"The mention of Marley's funeral brings me back to"
"66",46,"the point I started from. There is no doubt that Marley"
"67",46,"was dead. This must be distinctly understood, or"
"68",46,"nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going"
"69",46,"to relate. If we were not perfectly convinced that"
"70",46,"Hamlet's Father died before the play began, there"
"71",46,"would be nothing more remarkable in his taking a"
"72",46,"stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,"
"73",46,"than there would be in any other middle-aged"
"74",46,"gentleman rashly turning out after dark in a breezy"
"75",46,"spot--say Saint Paul's Churchyard for instance--"
"76",46,"literally to astonish his son's weak mind."
"77",46,""
"78",46,"Scrooge never painted out Old Marley's name."
"79",46,"There it stood, years afterwards, above the warehouse"
"80",46,"door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was known as"
"81",46,"Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the"
"82",46,"business called Scrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley,"
"83",46,"but he answered to both names. It was all the"
"84",46,"same to him."
"85",46,""
"86",46,"Oh! But he was a tight-fisted hand at the grind-stone,"
"87",46,"Scrooge! a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping,"
"88",46,"clutching, covetous, old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint,"
"89",46,"from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire;"
"90",46,"secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster. The"
"91",46,"cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed"
"92",46,"nose, shrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his"
"93",46,"eyes red, his thin lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his"
"94",46,"grating voice. A frosty rime was on his head, and on his"
"95",46,"eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his own low"
"96",46,"temperature always about with him; he iced his office in"
"97",46,"the dog-days; and didn't thaw it one degree at Christmas."
"98",46,""
"99",46,"External heat and cold had little influence on"
"100",46,"Scrooge. No warmth could warm, no wintry weather"
"101",46,"chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than he,"
"102",46,"no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no"
"103",46,"pelting rain less open to entreaty. Foul weather didn't"
"104",46,"know where to have him. The heaviest rain, and"
"105",46,"snow, and hail, and sleet, could boast of the advantage"
"106",46,"over him in only one respect. They often ""came down"""
"107",46,"handsomely, and Scrooge never did."
"108",46,""
"109",46,"Nobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with"
"110",46,"gladsome looks, ""My dear Scrooge, how are you?"
"111",46,"When will you come to see me?"" No beggars implored"
"112",46,"him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him"
"113",46,"what it was o'clock, no man or woman ever once in all"
"114",46,"his life inquired the way to such and such a place, of"
"115",46,"Scrooge. Even the blind men's dogs appeared to"
"116",46,"know him; and when they saw him coming on, would"
"117",46,"tug their owners into doorways and up courts; and"
"118",46,"then would wag their tails as though they said, ""No"
"119",46,"eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!"""
"120",46,""
"121",46,"But what did Scrooge care! It was the very thing"
"122",46,"he liked. To edge his way along the crowded paths"
"123",46,"of life, warning all human sympathy to keep its distance,"
"124",46,"was what the knowing ones call ""nuts"" to Scrooge."
"125",46,""
"126",46,"Once upon a time--of all the good days in the year,"
"127",46,"on Christmas Eve--old Scrooge sat busy in his"
"128",46,"counting-house. It was cold, bleak, biting weather: foggy"
"129",46,"withal: and he could hear the people in the court outside,"
"130",46,"go wheezing up and down, beating their hands"
"131",46,"upon their breasts, and stamping their feet upon the"
"132",46,"pavement stones to warm them. The city clocks had"
"133",46,"only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--"
"134",46,"it had not been light all day--and candles were flaring"
"135",46,"in the windows of the neighbouring offices, like"
"136",46,"ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The fog"
"137",46,"came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was"
"138",46,"so dense without, that although the court was of the"
"139",46,"narrowest, the houses opposite were mere phantoms."
"140",46,"To see the dingy cloud come drooping down, obscuring"
"141",46,"everything, one might have thought that Nature"
"142",46,"lived hard by, and was brewing on a large scale."
"143",46,""
"144",46,"The door of Scrooge's counting-house was open"
"145",46,"that he might keep his eye upon his clerk, who in a"
"146",46,"dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank, was copying"
"147",46,"letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk's"
"148",46,"fire was so very much smaller that it looked like one"
"149",46,"coal. But he couldn't replenish it, for Scrooge kept"
"150",46,"the coal-box in his own room; and so surely as the"
"151",46,"clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted"
"152",46,"that it would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore"
"153",46,"the clerk put on his white comforter, and tried to"
"154",46,"warm himself at the candle; in which effort, not being"
"155",46,"a man of a strong imagination, he failed."
"156",46,""
"157",46,"""A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!"" cried"
"158",46,"a cheerful voice. It was the voice of Scrooge's"
"159",46,"nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this was"
"160",46,"the first intimation he had of his approach."
"161",46,""
"162",46,"""Bah!"" said Scrooge, ""Humbug!"""
"163",46,""
"164",46,"He had so heated himself with rapid walking in the"
"165",46,"fog and frost, this nephew of Scrooge's, that he was"
"166",46,"all in a glow; his face was ruddy and handsome; his"
"167",46,"eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again."
"168",46,""
"169",46,"""Christmas a humbug, uncle!"" said Scrooge's"
"170",46,"nephew. ""You don't mean that, I am sure?"""
"171",46,""
"172",46,"""I do,"" said Scrooge. ""Merry Christmas! What"
"173",46,"right have you to be merry? What reason have you"
"174",46,"to be merry? You're poor enough."""
"175",46,""
"176",46,"""Come, then,"" returned the nephew gaily. ""What"
"177",46,"right have you to be dismal? What reason have you"
"178",46,"to be morose? You're rich enough."""
"179",46,""
"180",46,"Scrooge having no better answer ready on the spur"
"181",46,"of the moment, said, ""Bah!"" again; and followed it up"
"182",46,"with ""Humbug."""
"183",46,""
"184",46,"""Don't be cross, uncle!"" said the nephew."
"185",46,""
"186",46,"""What else can I be,"" returned the uncle, ""when I"
"187",46,"live in such a world of fools as this? Merry Christmas!"
"188",46,"Out upon merry Christmas! What's Christmas"
"189",46,"time to you but a time for paying bills without"
"190",46,"money; a time for finding yourself a year older, but"
"191",46,"not an hour richer; a time for balancing your books"
"192",46,"and having every item in 'em through a round dozen"
"193",46,"of months presented dead against you? If I could"
"194",46,"work my will,"" said Scrooge indignantly, ""every idiot"
"195",46,"who goes about with 'Merry Christmas' on his lips,"
"196",46,"should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried"
"197",46,"with a stake of holly through his heart. He should!"""
"198",46,""
"199",46,"""Uncle!"" pleaded the nephew."
"200",46,""
"201",46,"""Nephew!"" returned the uncle sternly, ""keep Christmas"
"202",46,"in your own way, and let me keep it in mine."""
"203",46,""
"204",46,"""Keep it!"" repeated Scrooge's nephew. ""But you"
"205",46,"don't keep it."""
"206",46,""
"207",46,"""Let me leave it alone, then,"" said Scrooge. ""Much"
"208",46,"good may it do you! Much good it has ever done"
"209",46,"you!"""
"210",46,""
"211",46,"""There are many things from which I might have"
"212",46,"derived good, by which I have not profited, I dare"
"213",46,"say,"" returned the nephew. ""Christmas among the"
"214",46,"rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas"
"215",46,"time, when it has come round--apart from the"
"216",46,"veneration due to its sacred name and origin, if anything"
"217",46,"belonging to it can be apart from that--as a"
"218",46,"good time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant"
"219",46,"time; the only time I know of, in the long calendar"
"220",46,"of the year, when men and women seem by one consent"
"221",46,"to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think"
"222",46,"of people below them as if they really were"
"223",46,"fellow-passengers to the grave, and not another race"
"224",46,"of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore,"
"225",46,"uncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or"
"226",46,"silver in my pocket, I believe that it has done me"
"227",46,"good, and will do me good; and I say, God bless it!"""
"228",46,""
"229",46,"The clerk in the Tank involuntarily applauded."
"230",46,"Becoming immediately sensible of the impropriety,"
"231",46,"he poked the fire, and extinguished the last frail spark"
"232",46,"for ever."
"233",46,""
"234",46,"""Let me hear another sound from you,"" said"
"235",46,"Scrooge, ""and you'll keep your Christmas by losing"
"236",46,"your situation! You're quite a powerful speaker,"
"237",46,"sir,"" he added, turning to his nephew. ""I wonder you"
"238",46,"don't go into Parliament."""
"239",46,""
"240",46,"""Don't be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow."""
"241",46,""
"242",46,"Scrooge said that he would see him--yes, indeed he"
"243",46,"did. He went the whole length of the expression,"
"244",46,"and said that he would see him in that extremity first."
"245",46,""
"246",46,"""But why?"" cried Scrooge's nephew. ""Why?"""
"247",46,""
"248",46,"""Why did you get married?"" said Scrooge."
"249",46,""
"250",46,"""Because I fell in love."""
"251",46,""
"252",46,"""Because you fell in love!"" growled Scrooge, as if"
"253",46,"that were the only one thing in the world more ridiculous"
"254",46,"than a merry Christmas. ""Good afternoon!"""
"255",46,""
"256",46,"""Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before"
"257",46,"that happened. Why give it as a reason for not"
"258",46,"coming now?"""
"259",46,""
"260",46,"""Good afternoon,"" said Scrooge."
"261",46,""
"262",46,"""I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you;"
"263",46,"why cannot we be friends?"""
"264",46,""
"265",46,"""Good afternoon,"" said Scrooge."
"266",46,""
"267",46,"""I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so"
"268",46,"resolute. We have never had any quarrel, to which I"
"269",46,"have been a party. But I have made the trial in"
"270",46,"homage to Christmas, and I'll keep my Christmas"
"271",46,"humour to the last. So A Merry Christmas, uncle!"""
"272",46,""
"273",46,"""Good afternoon!"" said Scrooge."
"274",46,""
"275",46,"""And A Happy New Year!"""
"276",46,""
"277",46,"""Good afternoon!"" said Scrooge."
"278",46,""
"279",46,"His nephew left the room without an angry word,"
"280",46,"notwithstanding. He stopped at the outer door to"
"281",46,"bestow the greetings of the season on the clerk, who,"
"282",46,"cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned"
"283",46,"them cordially."
"284",46,""
"285",46,"""There's another fellow,"" muttered Scrooge; who"
"286",46,"overheard him: ""my clerk, with fifteen shillings a"
"287",46,"week, and a wife and family, talking about a merry"
"288",46,"Christmas. I'll retire to Bedlam."""
"289",46,""
"290",46,"This lunatic, in letting Scrooge's nephew out, had"
"291",46,"let two other people in. They were portly gentlemen,"
"292",46,"pleasant to behold, and now stood, with their hats off,"
"293",46,"in Scrooge's office. They had books and papers in"
"294",46,"their hands, and bowed to him."
"295",46,""
"296",46,"""Scrooge and Marley's, I believe,"" said one of the"
"297",46,"gentlemen, referring to his list. ""Have I the pleasure"
"298",46,"of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr. Marley?"""
"299",46,""
"300",46,"""Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years,"""
"301",46,"Scrooge replied. ""He died seven years ago, this very"
"302",46,"night."""
"303",46,""
"304",46,"""We have no doubt his liberality is well represented"
"305",46,"by his surviving partner,"" said the gentleman, presenting"
"306",46,"his credentials."
"307",46,""
"308",46,"It certainly was; for they had been two kindred"
"309",46,"spirits. At the ominous word ""liberality,"" Scrooge"
"310",46,"frowned, and shook his head, and handed the credentials"
"311",46,"back."
"312",46,""
"313",46,"""At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,"""
"314",46,"said the gentleman, taking up a pen, ""it is more than"
"315",46,"usually desirable that we should make some slight"
"316",46,"provision for the Poor and destitute, who suffer"
"317",46,"greatly at the present time. Many thousands are in"
"318",46,"want of common necessaries; hundreds of thousands"
"319",46,"are in want of common comforts, sir."""
"320",46,""
"321",46,"""Are there no prisons?"" asked Scrooge."
"322",46,""
"323",46,"""Plenty of prisons,"" said the gentleman, laying down"
"324",46,"the pen again."
"325",46,""
"326",46,"""And the Union workhouses?"" demanded Scrooge."
"327",46,"""Are they still in operation?"""
"328",46,""
"329",46,"""They are. Still,"" returned the gentleman, ""I wish"
"330",46,"I could say they were not."""
"331",46,""
"332",46,"""The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour,"
"333",46,"then?"" said Scrooge."
"334",46,""
"335",46,"""Both very busy, sir."""
"336",46,""
"337",46,"""Oh! I was afraid, from what you said at first,"
"338",46,"that something had occurred to stop them in their"
"339",46,"useful course,"" said Scrooge. ""I'm very glad to"
"340",46,"hear it."""
"341",46,""
"342",46,"""Under the impression that they scarcely furnish"
"343",46,"Christian cheer of mind or body to the multitude,"""
"344",46,"returned the gentleman, ""a few of us are endeavouring"
"345",46,"to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and drink,"
"346",46,"and means of warmth. We choose this time, because"
"347",46,"it is a time, of all others, when Want is keenly felt,"
"348",46,"and Abundance rejoices. What shall I put you down"
"349",46,"for?"""
"350",46,""
"351",46,"""Nothing!"" Scrooge replied."
"352",46,""
"353",46,"""You wish to be anonymous?"""
"354",46,""
"355",46,"""I wish to be left alone,"" said Scrooge. ""Since you"
"356",46,"ask me what I wish, gentlemen, that is my answer."
"357",46,"I don't make merry myself at Christmas and I can't"
"358",46,"afford to make idle people merry. I help to support"
"359",46,"the establishments I have mentioned--they cost"
"360",46,"enough; and those who are badly off must go there."""
"361",46,""
"362",46,"""Many can't go there; and many would rather die."""
"363",46,""
"364",46,"""If they would rather die,"" said Scrooge, ""they had"
"365",46,"better do it, and decrease the surplus population."
"366",46,"Besides--excuse me--I don't know that."""
"367",46,""
"368",46,"""But you might know it,"" observed the gentleman."
"369",46,""
"370",46,"""It's not my business,"" Scrooge returned. ""It's"
"371",46,"enough for a man to understand his own business, and"
"372",46,"not to interfere with other people's. Mine occupies"
"373",46,"me constantly. Good afternoon, gentlemen!"""
"374",46,""
"375",46,"Seeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue"
"376",46,"their point, the gentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed"
"377",46,"his labours with an improved opinion of himself,"
"378",46,"and in a more facetious temper than was usual"
"379",46,"with him."
"380",46,""
"381",46,"Meanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that"
"382",46,"people ran about with flaring links, proffering their"
"383",46,"services to go before horses in carriages, and conduct"
"384",46,"them on their way. The ancient tower of a church,"
"385",46,"whose gruff old bell was always peeping slily down"
"386",46,"at Scrooge out of a Gothic window in the wall, became"
"387",46,"invisible, and struck the hours and quarters in the"
"388",46,"clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards as if"
"389",46,"its teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there."
"390",46,"The cold became intense. In the main street, at the"
"391",46,"corner of the court, some labourers were repairing"
"392",46,"the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,"
"393",46,"round which a party of ragged men and boys were"
"394",46,"gathered: warming their hands and winking their"
"395",46,"eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug"
"396",46,"being left in solitude, its overflowings sullenly congealed,"
"397",46,"and turned to misanthropic ice. The brightness"
"398",46,"of the shops where holly sprigs and berries"
"399",46,"crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale"
"400",46,"faces ruddy as they passed. Poulterers' and grocers'"
"401",46,"trades became a splendid joke: a glorious pageant,"
"402",46,"with which it was next to impossible to believe that"
"403",46,"such dull principles as bargain and sale had anything"
"404",46,"to do. The Lord Mayor, in the stronghold of the"
"405",46,"mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his fifty cooks"
"406",46,"and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor's"
"407",46,"household should; and even the little tailor, whom he"
"408",46,"had fined five shillings on the previous Monday for"
"409",46,"being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets, stirred up"
"410",46,"to-morrow's pudding in his garret, while his lean"
"411",46,"wife and the baby sallied out to buy the beef."

"1671",46,"believed it was the same, until he saw her, now a comely"
"1672",46,"matron, sitting opposite her daughter. The noise in this"
"1673",46,"room was perfectly tumultuous, for there were more children"
"1674",46,"there, than Scrooge in his agitated state of mind could count;"
"1675",46,"and, unlike the celebrated herd in the poem, they were not"
"1676",46,"forty children conducting themselves like one, but every"

"1678",46,"were uproarious beyond belief; but no one seemed to care;"
"1679",46,"on the contrary, the mother and daughter laughed heartily,"
"1680",46,"and enjoyed it very much; and the latter, soon beginning to"
"1681",46,"mingle in the sports, got pillaged by the young brigands"
"1682",46,"most ruthlessly. What would I not have given to be one of"

"1684",46,"wouldn't for the wealth of all the world have crushed that"

"1686",46,"shoe, I wouldn't have plucked it off, God bless my soul! to"
"1687",46,"save my life. As to measuring her waist in sport, as they"

"1695",46,"which would be a keepsake beyond price: in short, I should"
"1696",46,"have liked, I do confess, to have had the lightest licence"

"1933",46,"in the climate or the town, and yet was there an air of"
"1934",46,"cheerfulness abroad that the clearest summer air and brightest"
"1935",46,"summer sun might have endeavoured to diffuse in vain."

"1940",46,"snowball--better-natured missile far than many a wordy jest--"
"1941",46,"laughing heartily if it went right and not less heartily if it"
"1942",46,"went wrong. The poulterers' shops were still half open, and the"
"1943",46,"fruiterers' were radiant in their glory. There were great, round,"
"1944",46,"pot-bellied baskets of chestnuts, shaped like the waistcoats"
"1945",46,"of jolly old gentlemen, lolling at the doors, and tumbling out"
"1946",46,"into the street in their apoplectic opulence. There were"
"1947",46,"ruddy, brown-faced, broad-girthed Spanish Onions, shining in"
"1948",46,"the fatness of their growth like Spanish Friars, and winking"
"1949",46,"from their shelves in wanton slyness at the girls as they went"
"1950",46,"by, and glanced demurely at the hung-up mistletoe. There were"
"1951",46,"pears and apples, clustered high in blooming pyramids; there"
"1952",46,"were bunches of grapes, made, in the shopkeepers' benevolence"
"1953",46,"to dangle from conspicuous hooks, that people's mouths might"
"1954",46,"water gratis as they passed; there were piles of filberts, mossy"
"1955",46,"and brown, recalling, in their fragrance, ancient walks among"
"1956",46,"the woods, and pleasant shufflings ankle deep through withered"
"1957",46,"leaves; there were Norfolk Biffins, squat and swarthy, setting"
"1958",46,"off the yellow of the oranges and lemons, and, in the great"
"1959",46,"compactness of their juicy persons, urgently entreating and"
"1960",46,"beseeching to be carried home in paper bags and eaten after"
"1961",46,"dinner. The very gold and silver fish, set forth among"
"1962",46,"these choice fruits in a bowl, though members of a dull and"
"1963",46,"stagnant-blooded race, appeared to know that there was"
"1964",46,"something going on; and, to a fish, went gasping round and"

"1967",46,"The Grocers'! oh, the Grocers'! nearly closed, with perhaps"

"1969",46,"glimpses! It was not alone that the scales descending on the"
"1970",46,"counter made a merry sound, or that the twine and roller"
"1971",46,"parted company so briskly, or that the canisters were rattled"
"1972",46,"up and down like juggling tricks, or even that the blended"
"1973",46,"scents of tea and coffee were so grateful to the nose, or even"
"1974",46,"that the raisins were so plentiful and rare, the almonds so"
"1975",46,"extremely white, the sticks of cinnamon so long and straight,"
"1976",46,"the other spices so delicious, the candied fruits so caked and"
"1977",46,"spotted with molten sugar as to make the coldest lookers-on"

"1979",46,"were moist and pulpy, or that the French plums blushed in"
"1980",46,"modest tartness from their highly-decorated boxes, or that"
"1981",46,"everything was good to eat and in its Christmas dress; but"

"1984",46,"at the door, crashing their wicker baskets wildly, and left"
"1985",46,"their purchases upon the counter, and came running back to"
"1986",46,"fetch them, and committed hundreds of the like mistakes, in"
"1987",46,"the best humour possible; while the Grocer and his people"
"1988",46,"were so frank and fresh that the polished hearts with which"

"2313",46,"The children drank the toast after her. It was the first of"
"2314",46,"their proceedings which had no heartiness. Tiny Tim drank"
"2315",46,"it last of all, but he didn't care twopence for it. Scrooge"
"2316",46,"was the Ogre of the family. The mention of his name cast"
"2317",46,"a dark shadow on the party, which was not dispelled for full"
"2318",46,"five minutes."
"2319",46,""
"2320",46,"After it had passed away, they were ten times merrier than"
"2321",46,"before, from the mere relief of Scrooge the Baleful being done"
"2322",46,"with. Bob Cratchit told them how he had a situation in his"
"2323",46,"eye for Master Peter, which would bring in, if obtained, full"
"2324",46,"five-and-sixpence weekly. The two young Cratchits laughed"
"2325",46,"tremendously at the idea of Peter's being a man of business;"
"2326",46,"and Peter himself looked thoughtfully at the fire from"
"2327",46,"between his collars, as if he were deliberating what particular"
"2328",46,"investments he should favour when he came into the receipt"
"2329",46,"of that bewildering income. Martha, who was a poor"
"2330",46,"apprentice at a milliner's, then told them what kind of work"
"2331",46,"she had to do, and how many hours she worked at a stretch,"
"2332",46,"and how she meant to lie abed to-morrow morning for a"
"2333",46,"good long rest; to-morrow being a holiday she passed at"
"2334",46,"home. Also how she had seen a countess and a lord some"
"2335",46,"days before, and how the lord ""was much about as tall as"
"2336",46,"Peter;"" at which Peter pulled up his collars so high that you"
"2337",46,"couldn't have seen his head if you had been there. All this"
"2338",46,"time the chestnuts and the jug went round and round; and"
"2339",46,"by-and-bye they had a song, about a lost child travelling in"
"2340",46,"the snow, from Tiny Tim, who had a plaintive little voice,"
"2341",46,"and sang it very well indeed."
"2342",46,""
"2343",46,"There was nothing of high mark in this. They were not"
"2344",46,"a handsome family; they were not well dressed; their shoes"

"2346",46,"and Peter might have known, and very likely did, the inside"
"2347",46,"of a pawnbroker's. But, they were happy, grateful, pleased"

"2349",46,"they faded, and looked happier yet in the bright sprinklings"
"2350",46,"of the Spirit's torch at parting, Scrooge had his eye upon"

"2353",46,"By this time it was getting dark, and snowing pretty"

"2355",46,"the brightness of the roaring fires in kitchens, parlours, and"
"2356",46,"all sorts of rooms, was wonderful. Here, the flickering of"
"2357",46,"the blaze showed preparations for a cosy dinner, with hot"
"2358",46,"plates baking through and through before the fire, and deep"
"2359",46,"red curtains, ready to be drawn to shut out cold and darkness."
"2360",46,"There all the children of the house were running out"

"2362",46,"uncles, aunts, and be the first to greet them. Here, again,"
"2363",46,"were shadows on the window-blind of guests assembling; and"
"2364",46,"there a group of handsome girls, all hooded and fur-booted,"
"2365",46,"and all chattering at once, tripped lightly off to some near"

"2373",46,"piling up its fires half-chimney high. Blessings on it, how"
"2374",46,"the Ghost exulted! How it bared its breadth of breast, and"
"2375",46,"opened its capacious palm, and floated on, outpouring, with"
"2376",46,"a generous hand, its bright and harmless mirth on everything"
"2377",46,"within its reach! The very lamplighter, who ran on before,"
"2378",46,"dotting the dusky street with specks of light, and who was"
"2379",46,"dressed to spend the evening somewhere, laughed out loudly"

"2386",46,"of giants; and water spread itself wheresoever it listed,"
"2387",46,"or would have done so, but for the frost that held it prisoner;"
"2388",46,"and nothing grew but moss and furze, and coarse rank grass."
"2389",46,"Down in the west the setting sun had left a streak of fiery"

"2399",46,"A light shone from the window of a hut, and swiftly they"
"2400",46,"advanced towards it. Passing through the wall of mud and"

"2403",46,"children and their children's children, and another generation"

"2416",46,"the last of the land, a frightful range of rocks, behind them;"
"2417",46,"and his ears were deafened by the thundering of water, as it"
"2418",46,"rolled and roared, and raged among the dreadful caverns it"

"2645",46,"was. The brisk fire of questioning to which he was exposed,"
"2646",46,"elicited from him that he was thinking of an animal, a live"
"2647",46,"animal, rather a disagreeable animal, a savage animal, an"
"2648",46,"animal that growled and grunted sometimes, and talked sometimes,"
"2649",46,"and lived in London, and walked about the streets,"

"3752",46,"on such points, and like to see that everything is right."
"3753",46,""
"3754",46,"""Fred!"" said Scrooge."
"3755",46,""
"3756",46,"Dear heart alive, how his niece by marriage started!"
"3757",46,"Scrooge had forgotten, for the moment, about her sitting"
"3758",46,"in the corner with the footstool, or he wouldn't have done"
"3759",46,"it, on any account."
"3760",46,""
"3761",46,"""Why bless my soul!"" cried Fred, ""who's that?"""
"3762",46,""
"3763",46,"""It's I. Your uncle Scrooge. I have come to dinner."
"3764",46,"Will you let me in, Fred?"""
"3765",46,""
"3766",46,"Let him in! It is a mercy he didn't shake his arm off."
"3767",46,"He was at home in five minutes. Nothing could be heartier."
"3768",46,"His niece looked just the same. So did Topper when he"
"3769",46,"came. So did the plump sister when she came. So did"
"3770",46,"every one when they came. Wonderful party, wonderful"
"3771",46,"games, wonderful unanimity, won-der-ful happiness!"
"3772",46,""
"3773",46,"But he was early at the office next morning. Oh, he was"
"3774",46,"early there. If he could only be there first, and catch Bob"
"3775",46,"Cratchit coming late! That was the thing he had set his"
"3776",46,"heart upon."
"3777",46,""
"3778",46,"And he did it; yes, he did! The clock struck nine. No"
"3779",46,"Bob. A quarter past. No Bob. He was full eighteen"
"3780",46,"minutes and a half behind his time. Scrooge sat with his"
"3781",46,"door wide open, that he might see him come into the Tank."
"3782",46,""
"3783",46,"His hat was off, before he opened the door; his comforter"
"3784",46,"too. He was on his stool in a jiffy; driving away with his"
"3785",46,"pen, as if he were trying to overtake nine o'clock."
"3786",46,""
"3787",46,"""Hallo!"" growled Scrooge, in his accustomed voice, as"
"3788",46,"near as he could feign it. ""What do you mean by coming"
"3789",46,"here at this time of day?"""
"3790",46,""
"3791",46,"""I am very sorry, sir,"" said Bob. ""I am behind my time."""
"3792",46,""
"3793",46,"""You are?"" repeated Scrooge. ""Yes. I think you are."
"3794",46,"Step this way, sir, if you please."""
"3795",46,""
"3796",46,"""It's only once a year, sir,"" pleaded Bob, appearing from"
"3797",46,"the Tank. ""It shall not be repeated. I was making rather"
"3798",46,"merry yesterday, sir."""
"3799",46,""
"3800",46,"""Now, I'll tell you what, my friend,"" said Scrooge, ""I"
"3801",46,"am not going to stand this sort of thing any longer. And"
"3802",46,"therefore,"" he continued, leaping from his stool, and giving"
"3803",46,"Bob such a dig in the waistcoat that he staggered back into"
"3804",46,"the Tank again; ""and therefore I am about to raise your"
"3805",46,"salary!"""
"3806",46,""
"3807",46,"Bob trembled, and got a little nearer to the ruler. He"
"3808",46,"had a momentary idea of knocking Scrooge down with it,"
"3809",46,"holding him, and calling to the people in the court for help"
"3810",46,"and a strait-waistcoat."
"3811",46,""
"3812",46,"""A merry Christmas, Bob!"" said Scrooge, with an earnestness"
"3813",46,"that could not be mistaken, as he clapped him on the"
"3814",46,"back. ""A merrier Christmas, Bob, my good fellow, than I"
"3815",46,"have given you, for many a year! I'll raise your salary, and"
"3816",46,"endeavour to assist your struggling family, and we will discuss"
"3817",46,"your affairs this very afternoon, over a Christmas bowl of"
"3818",46,"smoking bishop, Bob! Make up the fires, and buy another"
"3819",46,"coal-scuttle before you dot another i, Bob Cratchit!"""
"3820",46,""
"3821",46,""
"3822",46,"Scrooge was better than his word. He did it all, and"
"3823",46,"infinitely more; and to Tiny Tim, who did NOT die, he was"
"3824",46,"a second father. He became as good a friend, as good a"
"3825",46,"master, and as good a man, as the good old city knew, or"
"3826",46,"any other good old city, town, or borough, in the good old"
"3827",46,"world. Some people laughed to see the alteration in him,"
"3828",46,"but he let them laugh, and little heeded them; for he was"
"3829",46,"wise enough to know that nothing ever happened on this"
"3830",46,"globe, for good, at which some people did not have their fill"
"3831",46,"of laughter in the outset; and knowing that such as these"
"3832",46,"would be blind anyway, he thought it quite as well that they"
"3833",46,"should wrinkle up their eyes in grins, as have the malady in"
"3834",46,"less attractive forms. His own heart laughed: and that was"
"3835",46,"quite enough for him."
"3836",46,""
"3837",46,"He had no further intercourse with Spirits, but lived upon"
"3838",46,"the Total Abstinence Principle, ever afterwards; and it was"
"3839",46,"always said of him, that he knew how to keep Christmas"
"3840",46,"well, if any man alive possessed the knowledge. May that"
"3841",46,"be truly said of us, and all of us! And so, as Tiny Tim"
"3842",46,"observed, God bless Us, Every One!"
